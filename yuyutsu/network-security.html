      <h1>Concerned About Network's Security?</h1>
      <img src="assets/img/yuyutsu-banner_03.png" alt="network-security" class="featured-image">
      <p>Many companies suffer from numerous network security problems without ever actually realizing it. What’s worse, when these problems go unresolved, they can create openings for attackers to breach a company’s security infrastructure to steal data and generally wreak havoc.</p>
      <p>Of course, it doesn’t necessarily need to be hackers or malware either. Network security can often be severely compromised by unintentional human errors as well.</p>
      <p>One of your biggest threats, even though you might not have thought about it are your employees themselves. About 60% of all attacks were carried out by insiders themselves. Whether it’s intentional leaks and misuse of account privileges, or identity theft arising from a phishing campaign or other social engineering attack that compromises their user account data, the people inside your business represent one of the biggest security problems you’ll ever face.</p>
      <p>Because these threats come from trusted users and systems, they’re also among the hardest to identify and stop.</p>
      <p>However, with proper network security protocols in place, you’ll be able to identify and ward off all possible threats and inadvertent mistakes.</p>
      <h2>We Provide</h2>
      <h3>1. Firewalls</h3>
      <p>Firewalls are always the first line of defense when it comes to network security. Firewalls put up a barrier between your trusted internal network and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. They use a set of defined rules to allow or block traffic. A firewall can be hardware, software, or both. Investing in a strong firewall will help you identify threats and completely prevent unauthorized intrusions.</p>
      <h3>2. Bandwidth Throttling</h3>
      <p>Bandwidth throttling is when an ISP purposely slows down your internet speed based on what you are doing online. It is a reactive measure employed in communication networks to regulate network traffic.</p>
      <p>Throttling can be used to actively limit a user's upload and download rates when the user is deemed to be doing something suspicious. Protocols can be put into place to prevent certain types of network usage on a computer, which would prevent activities like hacking, phishing, etc. It can even be used on programs such as video streaming, BitTorrent protocols and other file sharing applications.</p>
