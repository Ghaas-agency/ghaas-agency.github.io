      "text": "On April 15th 2020, the Government of India, as part of order №40–3/2020-DM-I (A), issued as part of the consolidated revised guidelines by the ministry of home affairs, made it mandatory for all employers, who resume functioning post-COVID-19 lockdown in the country, to provide medical insurance to their employees.
 
Not just that, insurance protection is the most preferred benefit by employees.. That’s because it takes the challenge of finding the right policy, helps them in managing healthcare costs and ensures that they get easy claims. So, when you provide health insurance, your employees feel cared for."

Insurance is a subject that can be complex at times and has many associated implications on benefits and premium. An intermediary works closely with the companies and also with insurance companies. First, they understand the need of the companies with respect to protection for its employees and then work with multiple insurance companies to develop a customized and efficient solution."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "There are many features and benefits that vary from one solution. Few of the important ones are:
Sum insured
Employee-only cover, or family cover (spouse, kids, and parents) 
Maternity cover  
Pre-existing disease cover 
Waiting periods
Disease or treatment wise capping
Room rent and ICU capping
Pre and post hospitalization expenses
 
Quite often, you would get a surprisingly low price from an insurance provider, but the solution would come with limited benefits and many restrictions/cappings. Plum brings this much-needed transparency into insurance."
