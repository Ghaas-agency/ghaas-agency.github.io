          <div class="info__main-content">Dear colleagues, <br/>Growing together, connecting communities is an apt theme for this edition of the Mobility newsletter. Thephrase couldn’t be more apt–given the present times. The coronavirus outbreak has dramatically changed our lives including our relationships with other people in our communities, our families, our homes, and our workplace. We have missed seeing everyone as we try to keep each other safe.</div>

          housemates, or both- not to mention pets. Despite the
          downside of the pandemic- we are also witnessing rays of hope
          in various walks of life with widespread outpouring of charity,
          togetherness, and empathy for strangers. This has redefined
          what ‘community’ means in the current times.</p>
          <p>Throughout this crisis, technology has become the connective
          tissue that binds us together, from video calls to new tech ideas.
          Be it at our homes or in industries, we are increasingly turning
          to technological innovators like you to build resilience. If social
          distancing is the norm now, technology appears to be the
          medicine that connects us now.</p>
          <p>This is clearly seen in the way you adapted to the crisis,
          transitioned to an entirely virtual environment dealing with the
          isolation due to the high number of cases that Pune faced. It’s
          been tough, but in all this you always kept the focus on the

          <p>In March 2020, we decided that it’s not a question of whether
          we ‘can’ or not pull this off but a question of ‘how’ we should
          pull this off. Together, we decided that we’d set a completely
          virtual team of the MO-IT India Hub–even when it was an
          unexplored path for us.</p>
          <p>Now that I look back, I can say with certainty that we took the
          right decision. In close cooperation with the local HR and talent
          acquisition team, with the help of innovative IT solutions, we
          succeeded in conducting 500+ virtual job interviews. Through
          that, we onboarded 40 colleagues in less than 6 months.
          However, onboarding our colleagues were just the beginning.
          The real challenge was to cultivate team-spirit and smoothen
          collaboration in a team that’s never even seen each other.</p>
          <p>To address this, we at Siemens Mobility IT India Hub
          started multiple initiatives to boost interaction. We started
          with the buddy-program wherein a buddy was assigned to every
          new member to interact with and to reach out for help.
          In addition to that, we chalked out a 50/100 days plan for
          each individual to help them focus their efforts in the right
          direction. To further aid our new colleagues, we organized
          multiple knowledge transfer sessions from industry experts.
          Lastly, to ease their relationship with their team members and
          foster a feeling of togetherness, we organized virtual
          get-togethers, monthly team events, family appreciation
          meets, German language lessons.</p>
          <ul class="page-indicators page-indicators--blue page-indicators--static">
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li class="active"></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>Our efforts bore fruits sooner than we had expected. Within 3
          months of joining, most of our new colleagues were able to take
          on responsibilities in various areas such as ERP activities, PLM
          space, global infrastructure, and CRM projects.</p>
          <p>We have several other initiatives planned to continue building
          the spirit of collaboration within the team. All our efforts are
          towards a shared vision: to seamlessly integrate into the global
          team and enable Mobility IT to grow by providing additional
          capacity and relevant expertise.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, we aim to deliver innovative and high-quality
          products and become a trusted business partner. By building a
          team of more than 40 people fully virtually in less than 6
          months we demonstrated capabilities to “walk the talk” at
          Mobility IT India Hub.</p>
          <p>We’ve established that we deliver on our commitments and we
          grow stronger together. A testament to this is the fact that we
          have been receiving countless referrals from our new team
          members for open positions at the Hub. Clearly, our comrades
          are enjoying the environment we’ve built and trust us enough to
          help us grow by recommending suitable profiles.
          All said and done, our journey has just begun. The Mobility IT
          India Hub is well supported by the entire senior management of
          Siemens Mobility.</p>

          <p>The month of October was particularly exciting for those who love to rhyme. We organized a poetry competition across the Pune team and rewarded people in three rounds. First of all, we shared entries on Yammer and got people to vote for their favorites there itself. Then, we also organised a live Mushaira to add to the fun. Lastly, we also rewarded entries based on our Jury’s vote.</p>

          <p>Festivals are the perfect time to rejoice and bond. But more importantly, they are the perfect excuse to dress up and click pictures. So, to boost up the excitement in our colleagues this festive season, we decided to give them one more reason to deck up. As a part of our virtual Navratri-cum-Dussehra celebrations, we asked people to send in their best pictures in the festive attire and rewarded the most well-dressed and joyful ones. We also encouraged teams to participate together by sharing a collage of their festive pictures. The celebration was brought to an end by an engaging and fun riddle nightwherein our colleagues battled to solve some really fun riddles presented to them.</p>

          <p>Everyone has their own way of celebrating Diwali. Some fill their homes and workplaces with lights and diyas. For some, it’s the perfect time to gorge on delicious delicacies while for others it’s time to bring out their favorite ethnic wear. Amongst it all, the most creative and colourful part of the Diwali celebration is the Rangoli, which we make to beautify our living spaces. This Diwali, we decided to capture these lovely rangolis our colleagues made through a Rangoli Competition. We got numerous entries and the best ones got exciting prizes too.</p>
