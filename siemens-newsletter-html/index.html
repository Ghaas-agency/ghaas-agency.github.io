          <p>Dear All,<p>
          <p>It's been 4 months since the last installment of Mobility Pune Newsletter. So, here we are with the Sixth Edition of the Newsletter. This quarter we saw Covid making a roaring comeback. Hope everyone is taking necessary precautions , protecting themselves adequately and taking all the necessary steps to tide over the 2nd wave.<p>
          <p>As a business having delivered a commendable performance in spite of all challenges, the focus across all 3 groups within Pune Mobility umbrella has been on growth. We as an organization are moving away from traditional ways of career & personal growth planning with adoption of GrowthTalks. With this background this issue has "Growth" as the underlying theme.<p>
          <p>We start this edition with writeup by Shrikant Vachaspati on "Growth Talks" providing us an Outside In perspective. You will find insightful write ups from various projects that are taking growth journey in the "Growth Stories" section. We have also streamlined the structure of the newsletter a bit to accomodate more content as we now have all 3 groups Mobility Advanta, Mobility IT Hub & COBRA contributing equally.<p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Over the last few editions, the newsletter has been shared by you with many of your global counterparts. In order to make the distribution easier we now are publishing newsletter first in Web format, following up with a PDF version. This should help make sharing the newsletter a little easier</p>
          <p>As usual we look forward to your inputs to make the newsletter more interesting, useful & readable. Please do not hesitate to provide feedback in the feedback form.</p>
          <p>Hope you all stay safe, stay positive & continue doing wonderful things that you have been doing during these challenging times</p>
          <p><strong>Best Regards,<br/>Chintan , Jayram & Aravind</strong></p>

            <p><strong>"Focus on the most important aspect, your growth."</strong></p>
            <p>Faster business cycles and new challenges demand a growth mindset—staying curious, being resilient, experimenting, and adapting. To strengthen our performance through individual growth​, we need a mindset change towards ownership, continuous dialogue, learning and growth to strengthen our people’s performance. This is the Growth Talks approach.</p>

          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Introducing Growth Talks</h3>
          <p>In its simplest form, a Growth Talk is purely a future-focused exchange between people that results in learning and progress toward a goal. The shared objectives of all exchanges is to be development-oriented and performance enhancing.</p>

          <p>We replace our system-driven annual processes with engaging, jointly-driven conversations that focus on individual growth and drive business success. These conversations and exchanges can be approached in many different ways, depending on the situation.</p>

          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confirming alignment of work toward achieving strategic business goals.</li>

            <p>What does growth mean and why it is important is a question that we ask ourselves so very often. The drive for achieving bigger goals and moving ahead has been a constant human endeavor. And it does not matter what level you peg your goals; the aim is to do better than what you are doing now. There are many forces that work on us in influencing this growth, both internal  and external. And in a world that is now VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) in its nature, the external forces have multiplied, both in number and impact.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
            <p>As the Red Queen said in Alice In Wonderland, you need to run fast to stay in the same place. And if you want to reach someplace else, you need to run twice as fast.</p>
            <p>Traditional Growth has placed the onus on the organization, the managers to provide direction. Growth was time bound and skill building was one dimensional. But with an ever changing environment, there are aspects in terms of mind shifts and behavior that are essential to harness the potential of growth in the VUCA world. Let us examine a few of them - </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Employees need to take ownership to lead the way by developing their capacity, constantly deepening their self-awareness. They should routinely challenge their understanding of themselves, their strengths, opportunities, interests and values, extracting lessons from challenges and failures, and update their understanding of the unique value proposition they have to offer.
            </li>
            <li>As employees deepen their self-awareness and develop the habit of reflection, it becomes incumbent upon leaders to understand and act on this information and insights. This happens through conversations that are an ongoing dialogue and routine interactions. This is what at Siemens we have adapted in the form of <strong>Growth Talks.</strong> </li>
            <li>With VUCA in play, career-development plans can no longer be cast in concrete. Employees need to play out multiple possibilities concurrently, holding each lightly and being willing to change as necessary. This calls for an agile outlook at career opportunities and growth.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <ul>
            <li>Employees and leaders will move heavily into informal or unstructured learning (which includes development experiences, mentoring, visibility, and networking) to offer on-the-spot or targeted high-impact actions that work within the employee’s (versus the organization’s) timeline.</li>
            <li>Fitting development into already overwhelming workloads can be challenging. It’s easy for employees to let their growth and learning take a backseat to more urgent concerns. We need to ensure that the environment at work encourages employees to work their developmental intentions, by acknowledging the acquisition of new skills or experiences. With the new Global Learning Platform, Siemens has made it easier for employees to digitally learn.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Careers exist in today’s VUCA environment; but career development and growth continue to thrive even in these challenging conditions. With COVID and a largely work from home environment that is likely to continue for some more time to come, the use of digital platforms to learn new skills, and virtually come together for innovation offers tremendous  opportunity for employees and leaders who are willing to make the process more versatile, uplifting, choice-filled and active. </p>

          <p>Dear All,</p>
          <p>Happy to interact with you for the sixth time through our quarterly newsletter. I am glad that we have accepted that we are living in VUCA times! I have been talking about this for more than a decade now. It is not a transient state but is here to stay. This has happened not just because of geopolitical and economic reasons but also due to emerging technologies. I see this as a renaissance!</p>

          <p>Let us learn to appreciate, adapt, and apply ourselves to contribute to upsurge collectively. During these changing times, our vision has not changed. We see ourselves to be the top software house within Mobility.</p>

          <p>The overall market situation is demanding, with customers expecting more with less. Our efforts to provide cost-competitive and high-quality solutions will certainly lend support there. But what we need to develop and enhance is our competency to handle end-to-end solutions. We have understood that this is possible only if product, Development, Technology, Infrastructure, Business Excellence, HR, and BA teams work collaboratively, with each having a higher degree of competence in respective functions.</p>

          <p>I feel proud that during these times, we have not let the ball drop. In fact, as individuals and as a collective, we have demonstrated dedication, support, willingness to help and most importantly, willingness to meet challenges!</p>

          <p>Our product organization, aka LHS, has worked relentlessly to pursue opportunities with excellent support from SMO and ADVANTA management. We have been able to win some opportunities such as Delhi Metro, SILTS, and NYQBL train monitoring in the space of IEB. At the same time, we have started our engagement in additional CORE topics, for example, Simis W, WESTLOCK, UDS, SCOT tool development, Taiwan Unit testing, EOT, and DSM "Add some ITS example here." This would not have been possible without proactive support from MOTO and Development teams. This is exactly what we need in an organization with a growth mindset.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>To increase our partner's confidence in us, we will have to develop bootstrap models for productivity, agility, and quality. This is only possible if we continue to invest in talent acquisition, development, and retention. The leadership team at different levels is taking multiple actions to understand and address it transparently. What we now need the most is connection, grit, and gumption! We should also continue to think and act like a startup with a large organization.</p>
          <p>I thank all of you again for your continued positive contributions, dedication & focus. Stay healthy, stay safe!</p>

            <p>Dear all,</p>
 
            <p>What an interesting year 2020 was! For Mobility IT, it was a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups and downs but more importantly, we kept moving forward.</p>
            <p>We started our journey in the middle of the lockdown last year and had our first remote joiner in the last week of June 2020.</p>
             
          </div>

        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Now, as of April 2021, we are a team of more than 50 bright-minded colleagues, all onboarded fully virtually and performing excellently without meeting each other face to face even once! I believe this has never been done before within a house of Siemens and I take pride in all the accomplishments our team was able to achieve.</p>
          
          <p>Talking about accomplishments, in the last quarter, we did successful insourcing of PLM services from Atos, in time and in scope, and now our PLM team is fully delivering those services out of our IT HUB in Pune. This has resulted in better quality control over the service offerings and optimized efforts on service delivery. Our infrastructure team also successfully completed a global SharePoint migration project that resulted in improved efficiency, cost optimization, and scalability. There are many more such accomplishments and I am sure that there will be many more in the times to come.</p>
 
          <p>As part of our growth plans, we are planning on doubling our strength by the end of FY21. From a team of 50, we will become a team of 100 plus members in 7 months. This shows that we have a robust demand pipeline and support from global Siemens Mobility management to grow further. With offices remaining closed for more than a year now, all of this will need to be achieved virtually. Managing a team of more than 100+ bright minds completely virtually is a challenge as well as a new opportunity in itself. Virtual onboarding has helped us in ramping up quickly, but it comes with its own challenges, such as difficulty in understanding a person’s body language and non-verbal cues. But this is the new normal, and as an organization, we will continue our journey to the next level.</p>

          <p>One of the key activities that happened in the last quarter was the discussions between the COBRA Steering Committee & COBRA team. The discussion involved presentations and addresses by technical and commercial business segment leaders of Main Line (Ricardo Ramos and Nusha Heit), Mass Transit (Marc Ludwig and Ishita Aggarwal) Electrification (Markus Zachmeier and Bernd Blumenstein). The main topics covered in these meetings were a self-introduction of the segment leaders to the Cobra team, elaboration on activities for each respective segment into which the Cobra team is involved followed, segment financials followed by a Q&A session.</p>

          <p>A COBRA town hall which was held by the RI business leaders Andre Rodenbeck and Eva Scherer concluded the meeting session. After introducing themselves Andre and Eva gave an insight on the RI business perspective as well as on the rationale behind the creation of Cobra. They also shared the following slide on their expectation towards the Cobra employees:</p>

          <p>I could say that these sessions have reduced the gaps between the newly formed COBRA team in India and the leaders of various departments across the globe who has been the main pillars of COBRA. The question that was mostly asked by the participants is that “What is COBRA in your view?” and the answers given by the moderators has made us understand the real motto behind COBRA and has enhanced our way of perceiving the importance of this new group. Thanks for all the leaders for the interest they have shown in answering the queries and for their valuable time.</p>

          <p>How many times we have looked at famous leaders with awe and admiration. Forgetting that we personalize this virtue almost subconsciously... For us, the leadership and persona of an individual become one. The problem with this perspective is that we divide our pack into ‘Leaders’ and ‘Followers’ as if it's a lifelong fate and faith that is rigid and unchangeable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>But ‘to lead’ is a function, a role that can be very dynamic, the style can change, the person can change and also there can be a role reversal. A leader for a particular task, project, or responsibility can be a follower in the next endeavour. In today's world, ‘leadership’ needs to be a ‘Functional Proactivity’ based on a person’s mastery of that particular skill, quality or aptitude. Hence, leadership does not become an exclusive role but an inclusive responsibility. </p>

          <p>In 1930, just before Gandhiji started the epic Salt March, he distributed regional and local responsibilities to the last layer of workers, clearly stating who was to replace whom in case the initial leaders got arrested. Someone asked him, “In case all your batches of leaders get arrested, then?” “The battle itself will throw-up new leaders”, said Gandhiji. It was his faith that each person has a leader within, and if committed to a goal, those hidden pearls start shining.</p>

          <p> By September 1930, when the entire leadership was behind bars, the chain of satyagraha continued till January 1931 by heroes, unheard of till then. For any organisation, this is an important example. As a culture, we are more prone to looking at particular charismatic figures and personalities as ‘saviours’.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>In a famous sloka from the Gita, the ‘me’ is not a person but ‘divine leadership’ getting expressed through many people.</p>

          <p>Let us ‘normalize’ leadership. Let the last person in an organisation inculcate his own touch of leadership.... his own expression of the divine essence. The process of actively leading can be extremely educative and thrilling, though at times burdensome. But it can give a golden touch to an otherwise mundane life. We have seen countless times that during times of crisis, unknown people stand tall and deliver beyond their capabilities.</p>

          <p>It's my humble contention that the future belongs to a collective leadership that respects the value of interdependence. In fact ‘leadership for interdependence’ is a function so clearly seen in nature. The leaves of a plant ‘lead’ photosynthesis, the flowers ‘lead’ pollen spread, and the roots ‘lead’ the nutritional function.</p>

          <p>Without competing they lead the tree towards blossoming and optimising its potential. And when we own the responsibility, we actually start enjoying the very experience of leadership. When all these functional leaders help the tree express its ‘TREENESS’ in its totality, each function also gets optimally fulfilled. Interestingly none of these ‘functional leaders’ ask for a separate acknowledgment. They merge their aspirations with the whole ‘TREENESS’. </p>

          <p>Civilizations have survived on these critical expressions by unknown leaders. It's time we underline and revisit this fact in the current stream of extreme changes. That will add an interesting angle to effective coping for all of us.</p>

            RnD4.0 to RnDNG : <span class="highlight">Evolving With Changing Times</span>

          <p>The last year or so has seen all of us evolve. We have learnt to work, collaborate, survive & flourish in ways different from the ways we followed earlier. This evolution has been challenging, often making us throw many of the long held assumptions out of the window. The RnD4.0 program has been no exception to this.</p>

          <p>We launched the RnD4.0 program a couple of years back in order to help us be ready for many of the industry 4.0 challenges & also to help us be better prepared for the growth that we were foreseeing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p> Over the last 24 months, especially the year 2020, we have seen the need to decentralize, go virtual & distributed to answer the needs of these challenging times. RnDNG(Next Generation) is the next evolution of the RnD4.0 program in this direction. However, before we talk about what has changed, let's quickly look back at 2020 from RnD4.0 perspective.</p>
          
          <img src="newTheme/img/rnd-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-colored">
 
          <p>We evolved the program to suit the virtual world. Some of the initiatives had to be discontinued, some evolved & some new ones got added. We continued to get together to listen to technical presentations every alternate week in Tech Break Sessions. Having crossed a half century of the sessions, we took a short break from Tech Break & have returned in the new year with a new set of topics. ToastMasters club has now more than 75 sessions under its belt. It continues on a fortnightly basis. CI/CD initiative saw significant improvement in CI/CD maturity of the 10 targeted projects. The initiative is now being owned by DevOPS team.</p>
           
          <p>We did a very interesting domain express session on Tunnel Management. We have also found the limitations of the virtual world to do events like domain express. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>That has not stopped us from exchanging bits of knowledge oriented topics. Through ITS Quiz, Domain Quiz, Testing Bytes & Did You Know we have tried to bring around interesting bits of information & trivia to you. We launched domain dictionary to make it easy for you to get detailed understanding & information about various domain related topics.</p>

          <p>You continue to express your appreciation for all your colleagues through appreciation cards which saw a redesign this year. We have piloted a new innovation management process that is based on Shout Out Circles.</p>

          <p> Getting feedback from people is important to keep making things better. Various mechanisms like virtual Gemba walk, Project Reflections, and Retro Appetizers were used to collect the feedback which could be used for decision making at various levels. We have worked on streamlining the procurement process for hardware items to make life better for requesters as well as approvers.</p>

          <p>This newsletter, which is published every quarter, is also one of the initiatives within the RnD4.0 program. Now we have participation from all 3 Mobility groups based out of Pune. The newsletter is shared & appreciated globally.</p>
 
          <p>As we are taking this journey, we have also realized the need to distribute and align better. With that in mind we are reshaping the RnD4.0 program into RnDNG program. While the core values and way of working remains the same, the RnDNG program will have more participation from the G0T0 team. At least 2 G0T0 members have become champions for each of the levers.</p>

          <p>Looking back, we have accomplished a lot in these very challenging 12 months, with many exciting new ideas being discussed & implemented. All this is possible only because of strong leadership support, the passion & commitment from sherpas , and enthusiastic support from all of the employees of Advante Pune Mobility group.

In addition to fault finding and alert indications, it can also provide geolocation information of where the closest depot or access points are.

Simultaneously, the diagnostic data will be collected, stored, and used to provide diagnostic information to the final users using Siemens MindSphere® IoT Operating System Platform.</p>

            <p>With an eye on some operational challenges and future improvements, SMO Management has planned to standup a mechanical CAD (MCAD) support team at Pune centre. COVID-19 situation and Lockdowns forced us to rethink this plan. Still, management has decided to go for a completely Virtual Onboarding and successfully onboarded 12 Team members for PDMLink and Conversion team in Pune centre within 4 to 6 months.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>While we never imagined onboarding to a new job virtually, we are happy to report that things are going just smooth in the new normal. As we were located in different parts of India and our team is thousands of miles away from us in Europe, we felt much pressure - sometimes worrying if we made the right decision or not, by changing jobs when the whole world is in COVID-19 and the financial crisis. </p>
          <p>SMO Management and HR team helped to relieve some of this pressure by their caring approach towards new employees from the very first week. Virtual sessions like All Hand meetings, Buddy Talks, talks with CIO, Daily standups, Weekly team meetings, Jour Fixes, and German coaching helped build positive momentum in all teams to work together. </p>
          <p>We were also provided a one-time amount to set up home office furniture and IT accessories. Yoga and workout sessions were planned considering employee health and comfort.</p>
          <p> Good planning for knowledge sharing sessions and keeping breathing space between the sessions to digest the knowledge was essential. Also, there was enough overlap in Passive and Active shadowing with the ATOS Team to completely and successfully take over the ownership of the SMO MCAD support services starting from 1st January 2021.</p>
          <p>Insourcing will help us to take more ownership, raise flexibility, improve collaboration, lower overall cost and support our Business Units in a better way. Plans for the future are currently a major PLM system upgrade and the implementation of Teamcenter as our new PLM platform. Thank you to every member of SMO to make this Journey successful </p>

           2020 has been that year which taught us the importance of the above quote. It has completely changed the way most of us work. Our relationships with our colleagues have been redefined. Going for lunch together, having a cup of tea at the local tapri, celebrating birthdays – usually, these were the moments that helped us grow from a group of individuals to a team. Covid-19 has prevented us from enjoying such real-life moments, and it seems it might continue to do so for a while. However, this does not mean that we stop growing and connecting.
          </p>

          <p>The initial days of work from home were a huge adjustment, but we all learned to adapt ourselves. As part of this journey, we moved our day-to-day practices from the real world to this virtual world. Being part of a team meant a lot of things. A day in the office for our team generally started with the daily scrum meeting. Our first order of business was to conduct this online. Tracking this in such a way that the status is visible to all the stakeholders was very important.</p>
          <p>We now have a daily 15-minute standup facilitated by our Scrum Master, wherein each team member gives an update of the task they are working on using the RTC dashboard. In the absence of the scrum master, any team member steps up to conduct the same. This is true for all the agile ceremonies such as the Sprint review, Sprint retrospective and backlog grooming. </p>

          <p>It has been a continuous learning process to time box ourselves. However, we feel that the daily standup is essential for us as this is a required human connection we need to kick start our day.</p>
          <p>During the past year, we also had a successful release. This would not have been possible without the entire team's joint effort. In the beginning, it was a bit overwhelming to figure out how to work together virtually. We had a bit of a shaky start, but finally, we set ourselves a new rhythm.</p>

          <p>We learnt to break the tasks down into smaller stories to achieve better sprint velocity, spend more time in understanding the requirements together so that we could work on them individually, squinted away at the fine print-</p>

          <p>  of a screen shared during a call to discuss and debug solutions all the while keeping the goal of the release in mind. Siemens also ensured that we could grow individually by giving us access to different pieces of training and certifications. Team members have completed various activities such as IMS, AI/ML, etc.
          </p>
          <p>Being at home unable to interact with others does take its toll, though. Different people went through different emotional upheavals. However, we have always tried to maintain an open communication line, be it among ourselves or with our managers. We had talks wherein each team member openly spoke about the difficulties and challenges they were facing, and we tried figuring out how we could make things better for them. Every day we have a DND ( Do not disturb) time zone wherein we keep aside an hour roughly. It is the me-time for each individual wherein he/she is free to do whatever they want. It could be completing some housework, resting for some time or even just completing an individual task without having anyone disturb them at that time. </p>

          <p>As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". It was essential during these trying times to maintain the team spirit. We started with a Fun Friday every sprint where the entire team gets together and plays games. Before Covid-19, we would never have imagined that we would have had so much fun playing games such as Dumb Charades, Treasure Hunt, Fun Quizzes, Pictionary, Antakshari, Bingo! so many more virtually. Everyone participates wholeheartedly, and there is a competitive spirit like when we were kids! It's been a challenge to figure out something new each time, but the fun, happiness, stress release and bonding that takes place is a delight.</p>
          <p>We have had at least three new members join the team during this time, and we found that having such events was the best way to make them feel comfortable and welcome them into the team. </p>

          <p>No matter how big or small, we should celebrate and appreciate occasions and people. Appreciation cards have been doing the rounds for the excellent work an individual or the team has put in. At the same time, we have had many other reasons to celebrate, be it birthdays, marriages, anniversaries or births, we have been blessed. Not being able to celebrate in the office together did not stop us, however. Every birthday is celebrated with a small video filled with wishes and funny moments. We get together on call and sing Happy Birthday ( though we still haven't learnt how to sing together 😉 ) and pull each other's legs.</p>

            <p>Traffic congestion is becoming a critical issue day by day. This is due to the increased urbanization, industrialization, and vehicle density. Sometimes emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks are stuck in traffic and unable to reach in time for rescue.  </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>The worst traffic jams or long queues occur at intersections where cars, bikes, buses, or pedestrians cross the road. If we can manage traffic at such intersections, we might resolve this issue significantly. Almost all big cities have traffic signals and a dedicated traffic police force for managing everyday traffic. In case of emergencies, the police can use a traffic control panel to make dynamic signal changes or take control over intersection traffic manually.</p>
          
          <p>
            "Vehicle-Actuated Signals" is one of the preferred methods for optimizing intersection traffic. There are also various detectors used for actuation. e.g., inductive loop detectors, radar, RFID, or cameras. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="newTheme/img/traffic.jpg" alt="">
          </p>
          <p>Signal controller programs take these detector actuations as input from all approach lanes and dynamically adjust the signal timing plan and reduce queue length on all lanes as much as possible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>These steps help reduce congestion time significantly. Some cities have preferred special vehicle detection mechanisms to detect emergency vehicles and public transport vehicles to prioritize cross intersections.  </p> 

          <p>Typically, traffic signal controllers operate in three modes.</p>

          <p><strong>Pre-Timed Signal:</strong> In this mode, a traffic signal's Green-Amber-Red timing is fixed, and these patterns are repeated throughout the day. Sometimes, these fixed timing partners or designs are based on historical traffic scenarios. An example can be giving more time to the green signals in the morning, especially those that lead to offices or industrial areas. This will ensure the smooth movement of traffic.</p>

          <p><strong>Actuated Signal:</strong>  In this method, one can use vehicle detectors to detect traffic based on queue length, vehicle type, and priority; based on these factors, signal controllers can optimize signal timing dynamically. Taking the same scenario as above, if there is more traffic moving towards the office or industrial area, a lane could get maximum green time dynamically.</p>

            <p><strong>Mixed-Mode:</strong>   One can use this mode at major and minor traffic road junctions. Typically, major roads have fixed timing, and minor roads get actuated signals. By doing this, minor roads will get a green signal when there is sizable traffic. Otherwise, you end up prioritizing just major-road traffic.</p>

            <li>They require careful inspection & maintenance to ensure proper operation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Traffic engineers are coming up with newer concepts like Signal Synchronization, which allows coordinating traffic signals along a single route so that vehicles get a progressive green signal at each junction. This is another crucial aspect that we will discuss more in the upcoming newsletter.  </p>

              I started my journey in Ansible playbook automation with the idea of moving away from traditional script automation tools and deployment models on virtual machines to something more simple, sequential, agent-less, and powerful in terms of configuration management and workflow orchestration required in a Cloud environment. And Ansible was the answer.

          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Creating a Playbook — Know-How:</h3>

          <p>I began my first playbook creation by converting the existing Network Shell script for product installation on a virtual machine in a Cloud environment to a playbook. Playbooks are expressed in YAML format and mostly consist of a series of sequential ‘tasks’. At a very basic level, a task is nothing more than a call to an Ansible module, which is a predefined set of system commands, resources, etc.
          To have an overview of playbook creation, here is the official link to the documentation: AnsiblePlaybooks</p>

          <p>The most common errors faced while executing a playbook are:</p>
          
          <p><strong>1. No such file or directory</strong></p>
          
          <p>— Usually, for this kind of error, you need to look if the file is executable by checking the permissions of the file.</p>
          <p>— Another thing to check is if you are running the playbook as a root user or any other non-root Ansible user which has the required privileges to execute the playbook.</p>
          <p>— Another basic error could be that the file is not copied properly to the target server before execution</p>

          <p><strong>2. Permissions denied</strong></p>
          <p>— You may need to check if the user ID you’re using to execute the playbook on the server has the correct permissions to execute the playbook or if you need to root otherwise.</p>

            Magnification in train control system
          </h3>
          <div class="info__main-content">
            <p>Metro Signalling & Train control system technology focus means of reducing headway, ensuring safety, and improving efficiency and reduction in the cost of operation. The Signalling & Train Control system on Main Line Railways and Metros are different on account of very different traffic requirements besides civil and E&M infrastructure. Signalling & Train Control in metros not only ensures train safety, but it also integrates, interfaces, and automates areas of operation, driving, passenger information, collection of information, and analysis of the same. Signalling & Train Control systems have been dominated using Track Circuit-based Signalling & Train Control for more than five decades.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          
          <p>The success of Metro rail systems lies in their ability to provide frequent, fast, safe, and comfortable journeys in the urban conglomeration, not only to the regular commuters but also to the occasional traveler or tourist alike. Signalling and Train Control systems play a major role in achieving these objectives. While enhancing operational efficiency by providing control systems to achieve the target headway, it also always ensures the total safety of the train movements besides adding value to other systems by the on-line interface.</p>
          <p>The rapid developments in the computer and microcircuit technology, as well as telecommunication, have led to the development of Integrated Metro Control systems, in which computers (including failsafe forms of computers) fulfill many of the decision making roles traditionally performed by Train operators, station controllers, Traffic controllers, etc., eventually leading to the introduction of highly automated Metro Rail with driverless trains.</p>
          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Need for Train detection and methods used: </h3>
          <p>To convey information to a train about where to stop and at what speed to run required all the trains on any line to be detected automatically by the system. This was achieved by the invention of the so-called “Track circuits”. Track circuits were first invented in the USA (DC Track circuits) in 1872 and later picked up and improved by British railways. London Underground was the first large-scale user in a Metro rail network 1904-06.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
           <p>The need to provide information to train resulted in the invention of “Coded Track circuits” with modulation of a basic AC carrier with codes. These required insulated joints between sections of rails like earlier track circuits for demarcating the individual track circuit blocks. Later came the “Jointless Track circuits” which use audio frequencies and provide high impedance between adjacent track circuits by a tuning process thus avoiding the need for insulated joints. These are commonly called Audio frequency Track Circuits (AFTC) and these help in transmitting codes that modulate the basic AFTC carrier which in turn are picked up by an antenna suspended below the train. </p>
          <p>In addition to track circuits, another system called “Axle counter” is also used for train detection. In this method, axles are detected through a magnetic circuit linking a transmitter and a receiver across the rail, and whenever a metallic axle interposes the received signal drops are detected and counted as one pulse. In this manner, all the axles coming into one block are counted at the entry and if all the axles are counted out at the exit of the block the block is declared as clear.  </p>
          <p>In the latest advancement in Metro signalling, a system called Communication based train control (CBTC) has been in use for more than a decade. In this system, the primary train detection is purely based on a failsafe communication link between the train and the control center with the train communicating its position continuously and the control Centre communicates the position to other trains for maintaining the safety distance between two trains. Track circuits or axle counters if any are used only as a secondary detection in case the Metro operator desires a fallback system.</p>

              Characteristics of Communication-Based Train Control System (CBTC)
            </h3>
            <p>Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a railway signalling system that makes use of the telecommunications between the train and track equipment for traffic management and train control. CBTC systems enable, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signalling systems, which results more efficiently and safely to manage the railway traffic and improve headway.</p>
            <p>CBTC systems allow different levels of automation or Grades of Automation, GoA, as classified in the IEC 62290-1. CBTC is not a synonym for “driverless” or “automated trains” although it is considered as a basic technology for this purpose.</p>
            <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">
              Driverless Train Operation (DTO) and Unattended Train Operation (UTO): 
            </h3>            
            <p>More sophisticated systems free the driver from the need to be at the front of the train – referred to as Driverless Train Operation (DTO) or GOA level 3. In DTO the driver can move away from the front of the train but remains available to provide customer-facing duties and to drive the train in the event of a failure of the DTO/ATO system. </p>
            <p>As the driver is no longer able to see the route ahead this imposes a greater demand on guideway security and platform controls. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Platform screen doors must be provided, to allow ATO to handle door closing also on the signal from ATP that all the Platform Screen Doors have closed fully. </p>
          
          <p>In DTO, train doors and train departure from a station platform may also be controlled automatically or manually from a location other than a driver cab at the front of the train. ATO can be given the operating instructions by the ATS regarding dwell time and hold for regulating the train on platforms as required by the operational situation and in the normal course, the driver wherever he happens to be on the train is relieved of all operational workload. </p>

          <p>CCTV information of the inside of coaches is transmitted live in new systems to OCC for controllers to observe for any untoward incidents inside the moving train and with other advancements in prevention and detection of unauthorized access to the viaduct or tunnel, even a separate train operator is no longer required on the cab in the train. The space required for the equipment could also be saved and passenger capacity increased at the end cabs. Thus, it became possible to have an Unattended Train Operation. Driverless ATO without an on-board attendant is referred to as Unattended Train Operation (UTO) or GOA level 4. UTO can range from empty train movements ( only to a siding, or in an automated depot, for example) to the operation of trains in passenger service with no attendant on board. The latter requires that the reliability of the systems has to be of a higher level and the train can be operated remotely under failure conditions, or at the minimum can be reached by shore-based personal in a short period.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p> Passengers need to be reassured and hence good communication and CCTV links between the vehicle and an informed staff member at OCC or a specified location are essential.</p>

          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Benefits of CBTC</h3> 

          <h4>CBTC makes effective use of infrastructure in the following ways</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Allows trains at closer headways. </li>
            <li>Greater precision and control of trains is possible. </li>
            <li>Provides continuous safe train separation & over-speed protection. </li>
            <li>Utilizes the track most efficiently while ensuring safety. </li>

              Risks of CBTC
            </h3>
            <p>The primary risk of a CBTC system is that if the communications link between any of the trains is disrupted then all or part of the system might have to enter a failsafe state until the problem is remedied. Depending on the severity of the communication loss, this state can range from vehicles temporarily reducing speed, coming to a halt, or operating in a degraded mode until communications are re-established.</p>
            <p>Communications failures can result from equipment malfunction, electromagnetic interference, weak signal strength or saturation of the communications medium. In this case, an interruption can result in a service brake or emergency brake application as real-time situational awareness is a critical safety requirement for CBTC and if these interruptions are frequent enough it could seriously impact service.</p>
            <p>Cyber-physical challenge is the severe risk in this system. CBTC Systems that make use of open standards for wireless digital communications link have a much larger attack surface and can be subject to various types of hacking including intrusion of the communications network and tampering with safety-critical messages that, in the worst case, could result in a safety hazard.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          
          <p>CBTC systems may be designed with centralized supervision systems, to improve maintainability and reduce installation costs. If so, there is an increased risk of a single point of failure that could disrupt service over an entire system or line.</p>

            <p>According to me, innovation is creating something new or capturing some value-added ideas in a product/project/business for a specific problem statement. Innovation can be completely radical sometimes and sometimes just an improvement/enhancement. Innovation, which is non-obvious and novel in nature, is qualified for the IP. I always like to do innovation, and for that, I always try to observe problems in the system as a whole. Whenever a valid problem statement is identified, then I work towards its solution. For me, innovation benefitted in different ways; most importantly, it allows learning and deeply understanding the product/project/domain. Innovation also helps to create synergy between the teams, and sometimes innovation also helps to accelerate the product growth as per the market need.</p>

          <p>Innovation is nothing new to Siemens which bears the Tagline "Ingenuity for Life". We could find several examples upon this through the organisation's rich progression through years in various domains. Innovation is cultured and nurtured in Siemens through global competitions like Werner Von Siemens Award, Regional ones like IGNITE Rail UK Idea challenge and Local ones such as STSPL Inventor of the year Award, Designathon, Hackathon and Green Hackathon. These programmes offer necessary platforms for the employees to exhibit their innovative skills and nurture them with interesting interactions across various product lines. In addition to this Siemens Mobility, India has identified the following single point of contacts.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,</p>
            <p>I am K. Sakthisubramanian, joined as the Head of Engineering in the COBRA team. Being a part of the COBRA team where growth and development are the main goals, how it would be correct if GROWTH is not been voiced by me. So, I would like to share some thoughts and concepts of GROWTH in this article for everybody’s knowledge sake.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>The growth of an organization is not possible without having a strong goal, leadership with a vision and an enthusiastic team even if the funds are available.  Hence, when we talk about the growth of an organization it has the growth of the individuals in it which leads us to get a strong team with a leader. </p> 
        <p>Every time when I hear about “GROWTH”, the first thing which relates to me is the MINDSET.  The growth MINDSET which is a must need for the GROWTH of organization, individual career etc., </p>  
        <p>The Growth Mindset basically is about the way how every situation can be improved better through the previous experiences, lessons learnt and practices.  With a growth mindset, the failure is not considered as a detriment rather considered as a step closer to the success.   </p>
        <p>With the Growth mindset the organization and the individuals in the organization should start cultivating a strong culture of learning from every situation as the growth is a natural consequence of learning.  Regular discussions on the performances of the individuals need to be performed by the managers.  Leaders need to focus mainly on valuing the employee’s contributions, suggestions, and feedback in order to route to the success. There should be opportunities provided for the talent improvements of the individuals and time for generating innovative ideas in order to reach the success. Following the growth mindset is a “change in progress” in order to reach every new goal of the organization.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Having a growth mindset and willing to take new opportunities / risks to excel in your career are the main requirements for the success of every individual.  Putting the best efforts in line to reach the targets will take you to success.  The individual success will always move into the path of career growth.</p>
          <p>Let me tell a short story of my life which led to success.</p>
          <p>“I started my career as a trainee in 2004 at a HitachiRail company (earlier it was known as USS) in Bangalore, after a couple of months theoretical training on Railway Signaling  which includes 2 weeks of training in the Indian railway institute (IRISET).</p>
          <p> I was assigned as a site engineer in Allahabad, UP.  Having a little knowledge on signaling and products also being a born and brought up from a small town in Tamil nadu (a state from down south of India and my hometown is near to Kanyakumari the south end of India) first time I have to move to a different state which is around 2311KMs from my native where we don’t have an office and I don’t know anyone.  I am the only kid for my parents and need to leave them alone in which case my dad is a heart patient who had just got a cardiac arrest a couple of months ago.  </p>

            <p> Taking this challenge as an opportunity to learn the systems and develop my career I went to Allahabad, learned the HitachiRail system in detail facing all the criticalities in the field and was working there for a year.  Considering that after a year of my learning I will get an opportunity to move back myself to the design office in Bangalore (which is comparatively close to my native) however, I got another challenge as I got transferred to Firozpur, Punjab(near to the Pakistan Border)as a site manager(in-charge) based on my good performances in Allahabad. However, this was a challenge for me in my personal life as I have to further travel 1100 kms towards the north but considering it as an opportunity to prove myself further in a next level as a site in charge I went to Punjab and succeeded in that assignment as well.  Based on my performances and capabilities of independently handling the local contractors, customers and managing the site activities which includes the verification of the design during testing and commissioning, I got the opportunity to work on the biggest project KFW (in 2006).  Once I entered the KFW project I concentrated on design and proved myself on the design capabilities by placing myself in Noida office for around 6 years sacrificing my expectations to work in Bangalore.  My goal and my growth mindset doesn’t get stopped, it continued and made me come across all the hurdles before me and placed me in a lot of positions from Design engineer, Team leader, Work Package Leader,  Design Manager, etc., and officially to reach as the Head of Metro Application India in 2019 in HitachRail.</p>

          <p>Every individual team member is informed to consider the growth mindset as an important tool to get yourselves to your targets.  Nobody can stop you when you are ready to move towards your GROWTH with a growth mindset.  </p>

            <p>The term RAMS, apart from meaning Random Access Memory, also stands for Reliability Availability Maintainability and Safety, of which I am a member. The newborn team in Siemens Mobility is an active bunch of validators and safety engineers. We specialize in validation- and safety-related activities. This means we stamp the products that are fit and safe to use for railway applications. We are also invaluable when it comes to Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) and Customer Acceptance Assessments.</p>
            
            <p>While our early RAMS activities are confined to projects in the UK, our validation activities have been picked for projects in Germany and Spain. </p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>RAMS has grown phenomenally during the course of a year, from a one-member team to nine members today. This is all thanks to the continuous efforts and successful deliveries of assigned projects. The team always strives to find the balance between the project constraints and RAMS aspects which is no easy task to achieve. Our team drives on 3Cs - Competency, Collaboration, and Communication.  The competency aspect of the team is not only taken care of with keen and considerate criteria for eligibility but also periodic nurturing within the team through Knowledge Sharing Sessions (KSS). </p>

         <p>These sessions contain learnings from specific projects, discussion of concepts, and introduction of techniques. Collaboration is done by offering training to fellow teams on EN standards, RAMS topics, and validation aspects. At Advanta level, the collaboration is reflected in our support for their safety-related queries as most teams find it hard to find the safety relatedness of their project’s or product’s functionality. Communication plays a key role in our work profile. It’s the medium for successful and smooth competency development and collaboration. </p>

              "Skill" & "Competency" are buzzwords in all the talent centric industries across the world, including Mobility. While importance attached to it is understood, there are limited avenues to holistically understand it as is vs a futuristic state. Organizations define tangible goals for growth, but this area lacked enough focus to measure the goals! That’s where a focused competence development & management approach garnered such significance in these times. In the Mobility industry, safety is an important objective for organizations. Standards like EN50128 (approved by CENELEC), ISO9001 & IEC61508 make it necessary to demonstrate & manage the competence of personnel, apart from stringent quality aspects.

          <p>Talevo allows building a strategic talent management approach to define and track the competencies required for successfully delivering an organization’s business strategy. With this strategy, you can answer the following questions:</p>

              Imagine an employee struggling to deliver a project due to it requiring new skills and being unaware of whom to consult for technical issues. Think from the perspective of a manager of a team who has worked hard to ensure delivery despite skill gaps. Could he eliminate those risks or get the right people/expert help at the right time? How do we become a learning & future-ready organization with the talent we have in these VUCA times?

          <p>These are the challenges that the management at SMO DT IT HUB IN was trying to solve. Much to our fortune, the Advanta Pune Mobility team came up with a product that addresses these concerns while bringing both employees and managers in close alignment. And thus, the Talevo journey started for SMO DT IT HUB in India.</p>

          <p>Talevo is an in-house developed competency management system based on CENELEC standard and Master competency definition. It provides a clear framework of skills, application knowledge, and (behavior) abilities that employees must meet to fulfill their job expectations and contribute to the company's success. This product is developed to ensure competencies are captured, tracked, and updated in a transparent and easy way to help the site, department, and employees succeed. Talevo is an instrument to uncover gaps in the current state and empower users for quicker decisions to realize the organization’s vision. </p>
          <p>The rollout for Talevo in SMO DT IT HUB started on November 1st, 2020, and the date of handover to operations was decided as 15th February 2021. Within these timelines, all the modules comprising employee profile management, competency-based employee search, competency management, and competency review were scheduled to be completed. The HUB management decided to delegate the responsibility of Talevo Rollout to two project managers, Bhunesh Bhaskar & Abhishek Tripathi, from the Infrastructure Services team headed by Samarth Karnekar. </p>
        </div>
         <div class="col-md-4 info__col idea-box__col idea-box--alt">
          <p style="align-self: flex-start;">Since both these project managers had recently joined the organization, it was a great opportunity for them to showcase their project management skills. This rollout also gave them an opportunity to connect with their colleagues and team managers from different verticals within the HUB. Dividing all the activities into parallel work packages and adherence to timelines meant that the rollout was completed well within the given timeline. Post the successful implementation of this competency management system other business units and teams have started adopting the tool with the help of SMO DT IT HUB as a role model.</p>

          <p>Every big move on a new platform comes with a price tag. Saving on cloud maintenance holds a huge cost appeal, but migration can be so much more than that since migration projects run on three different costs – On-premises, Online, and Project and the efficiency saving comes with early ramp-down of legacy environment.</p>
          
          <p>With an accelerated project approach, we were able to bring down the costs by nearly 31%. </p>

          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">The Accelerated Approach</h3>    
          <p>We decided to onboard SharePoint consultants from Infosys and IBM, helping us migrate medium and highly complex sites in parallel with the partner appointed by Siemens IT – Atos –  to migrate simple sites. It also became easier to define the right priorities to migrate first, starting from sites that required minimal effort but generated high cost.</p>

          <p>Another major contributor was an efficient housekeeping survey performed via a small application, which resulted in the deletion of 20% of sites that were no longer in use.</p>
          
          <p>Communication and structured migration processes played a critical role, keeping our users up-to-date and offering a central application to get the live migration status of their respective sites.</p>
          <p>All the different strategies, plans, and actions resulted in 50% ram-down already - a pioneer among all Siemens organizations.</p>
