            <p>What does growth mean and why is it important is a question that we ask ourselves so very  often. The striving for achieving bigger goals, moving forward and ahead has been a  constant human endeavor. And it does not matter what level you peg your goals, the aim is to do better than what you are doing now. There are so many forces that work on us in influencing this growth, both internal  and external. And in a world that is now VUCA in its nature, the external forces have multiplied  both in number and impact.</p>
            <p>As the Red Queen said in AIW, you need to run fast to stay in the same place. And if you want to reach someplace else, you need to run twice as fast.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>Traditional Growth has placed the onus on the Organization the managers to provide direction and growth was time bound and skill building was one dimensional. But with a Volatile and ever changing environment, there are aspects in terms of mind shifts and behavior that is essential to harness the potential of growth in the VUCA world. Let us examine a few of them as below</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Employees need to take ownership to lead the way by developing their capacity , constantly deepening their self-awareness. They must routinely challenge their understanding of themselves, their strengths, opportunities, interests and values, extracting lessons from challenges and failure, and updating their understanding of the unique value proposition they have to offer.</li>
            <li>As employees deepen their self-awareness and develop the reflection habit, it becomes incumbent upon leaders to understand and act on this information and insight. And this happens through conversations that are an ongoing dialogue and routine interactions. This is what at Siemens we have adapted in the form of Growth Talks. </li>
            <li>VUCA development is flexible, adaptable and fluid and as a result, career-development plans can no longer be cast in concrete. Employees need to play out multiple possibilities concurrently, holding each lightly and being willing to change as necessary. This calls for an agile outlook at career opportunities and growth.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <ul>
            <li>Employees and leaders will move heavily into informal or unstructured learning (which includes development experiences, mentoring, visibility, and networking) to offer spot or targeted high-impact actions that work within the employee’s (versus the organization’s) timeline.</li>
            <li>Fitting development into already overwhelming workloads can be challenging. It’s easy for employees to let their growth and learning take a backseat to more urgent concerns. We need to ensure that the environment at work encourages employees to work their developmental intentions, by acknowledging the acquisition of new skills or experiences. With the new Global Learning Platform, Siemens has made it easier for employees to digitally learn.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Careers exist in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment; but career development and growth continues to thrive even in these challenging conditions. With COVID and a largely work from home environment that is likely to continue for some more time to come, the use of Digital platforms to learn new skills, and virtually come together for innovation offers tremendous  opportunity for employees and leaders who are willing to make the process more versatile, uplifting, choice-filled and active.</p>

          <p>I am glad that we have accepted that we are living in VUCA times! I have been talking about this for more than a decade now. It is not a transient state but an entirely new format. This has happened not just because of geopolitical and economic reasons but also due to emerging technologies. Honestly, it is a great time since it is renaissance time!</p>

          <p>Let us learn to appreciate, adapt, and apply ourselves to contribute to upsurge collectively. During these changing times, our vision has not changed. We see ourselves to be the top software house within Mobility.</p>

          <p>The overall market situation is demanding, with customers expecting more with less. Our efforts to provide cost-competitive and high-quality solutions will certainly lend support there. But what we need to develop and enhance is our competence to handle end-to-end solutions. We have understood that this is possible only if product, development, technology, infrastructure, process, HR, and BA teams work collaboratively, with each having a higher degree of competence in respective functions.</p>

          <p>I feel proud that during these times, we have not let the buck drop. In fact, individually and collectively, we have demonstrated dedication, support, and willingness to help and most importantly, willingness to meet challenges!</p>

          <p>Our product organization, aka LHS, has worked relentlessly to pursue opportunities with excellent support from SMO and ADVANTA management. We have been able to win some opportunities such as Delhi Metro, SILTS, and NYQBL train monitoring in the space of IEB. At the same time, we have started our engagement in additional CORE topics, for example, Simis W, Westlock, UDS, SCOT tool development, Taiwan Unit testing, EOT, and DSM "Add some ITS example here." This would not have been possible without proactive support from MOTO and Development teams. This is exactly what we need in an organization with a growth mindset.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>To increase our partner's confidence in us, we will have to develop bootstrap models for productivity, agility, and quality. This is only possible if we continue to invest in talent acquisition, development, and retention. The leadership team at different levels is taking multiple actions to understand and address it transparently. What we now need the most is connection, grit, and gumption!We should also continue to think and act like a startup with a large organization.</p>

            <p>Dear all,</p>
 
            <p>What an interesting year 2020 was! For Mobility IT, it was a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups and downs but more importantly, we kept moving forward.</p>
             
            <p>We started our journey in the middle of the lockdown last year and had our first remote joiner in the last week of June 2020. And now, as of February 2021, we are a team of more than 50 bright-minded colleagues, all onboarded fully virtually and performing excellently without meeting each other face to face even once! I believe this has never been done before within a house of Siemens and I take pride in all the accomplishments our team was able to achieve.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>Talking about accomplishments, in the last quarter, we did successful insourcing of PLM services from Atos, in time, in scope and now our PLM team is fully delivering those services out of our IT HUB in Pune. This has resulted in better quality control over the service offerings and optimized efforts on service delivery. Our infrastructure team also successfully completed a global SharePoint migration project that resulted in improved efficiency, cost optimization, and scalability. There are many more such accomplishments and I am sure that there will be many more in the times to come.</p>
 
          <p>As part of our growth plans, we are planning on doubling our strength by the end of FY21. From a team of 50, we will become a team of 100 plus members in 7 months. This shows that we have a robust demand pipeline and support from global Siemens Mobility management to grow further. With offices remaining closed for more than a year now, all of this will need to be achieved virtually. Managing a team of more than 100+ bright minds completely virtually is a challenge as well as a new opportunity in itself. Virtual onboarding has helped us in ramping up quickly, but it comes with its own challenges, such as difficulty in understanding a person’s body language and non-verbal clues. But this is the new normal, and as an organization, we will continue our journey to the next level.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>At SMO DT IT HUB, our colleague’s mental and physical well being is of the highest priority for us. In these stressful times, it is important to take care of your and your family’s physical health and adhere to the Siemens guidelines along with government regulations. We have had online sessions with experts addressing this topic. In a time when the boundaries between personal life and professional life are getting blurred day by day, it is important to focus on mental wellbeing as well. We have arranged mental wellbeing sessions with experts to help our team address such topics and will continue to do so.</p>
 
          <p>While we have coped well with the immediate challenges, the path forward is expected to be equally demanding with ITS carve out and SHERPA project and the changes at the global level. We need to ensure that the services being delivered out of the HUB are of high quality and we also need to build the capability to support future growth across various portfolios of services. With the great management team on board, I am confident that we at IT HUB will be able to achieve this. I must say that I feel privileged and proud to be a part of this team!</p>

          <p>How many times we have looked at famous leaders with awe and admiration. Forgetting that we personalize this virtue almost subconsciously... For us, the leadership and persona of an individual become one. The problem with this perspective is that we divide our pack into ‘Leaders’ and ‘Followers’ as if it's a lifelong fate and faith that is rigid and unchangeable.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>But ‘to lead’ is a function, a role that can be very dynamic, the style can change, the person can change and also there can be a role reversal. A leader for a particular task, project, or responsibility can be a follower in the next endeavour. In today's world, ‘leadership’ needs to be a ‘Functional Proactivity’ based on a person’s mastery of that particular skill, quality or aptitude. Hence, leadership does not become an exclusive role but an inclusive responsibility. </p>

          <p>In 1930, just before Gandhiji started his epic salt march, he distributed regional and local responsibilities to the last layer of workers, clearly stating who was to replace whom in case the initial leaders got arrested.</p>

          <p> Someone asked him, “In case all your batches of leaders get arrested, then?” “The battle itself will throw-up new leaders”, said Gandhiji. It was his
          faith that each person has a leader within, and if committed to a goal, those hidden pearls start shining.</p>

          <p>By September 1930, when the entire leadership was behind bars, the chain of satyagraha continued till January 1931 by heroes, unheard of till then. For any organisation, this is an important example. As a culture, we are more prone to looking at particular charismatic figures and personalities as ‘saviours’.</p>

          <p>In a famous sloka from the Gita, the ‘me’ is not a person but ‘divine leadership’ getting expressed through many people. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p> Let us ‘normalize’ leadership. Let the last person in an organisation inculcate his own touch of leadership.... his own expression of the divine essence. The process of actively leading can be extremely educative and thrilling, though at times burdensome. But it can give a golden touch to an otherwise mundane life. We have seen countless times that during times of crisis, unknown people stand tall and deliver beyond their capabilities.</p>

          <p>It's my humble contention that the future belongs to a collective leadership that respects the value of interdependence. In fact ‘leadership for interdependence’ is a function so clearly seen in nature. The leaves of a plant ‘lead’ photosynthesis, the flowers ‘lead’ pollen spread, and the roots ‘lead’ the nutritional function.</p>

          <p>Without competing they lead the tree towards blossoming and optimising its potential. And when we own the responsibility, we actually start enjoying the very experience of leadership. When all these functional leaders help the tree express its ‘TREENESS’ in its totality, each function also gets optimally fulfilled. Interestingly none of these ‘functional leaders’ ask for a separate acknowledgment. They merge their aspirations with the whole ‘TREENESS’. </p>

          <p>Civilizations have survived on these critical expressions by unknown leaders. It's time we underline and revisit this fact in the current stream of extreme changes. That will add an interesting angle to effective coping for all of us.</p>

            <p>Looking at some operational challenges and future improvements, SMO Management has planned to Insource mechanical CAD (MCAD) support team at Pune centre. COVID-19 situation and Lockdowns forced to rethink this plan. Still, management has decided to go for a completely Virtual Onboarding and successfully onboarded 12 Team members for PDMLink and Conversion team in Pune centre within 4 to 6 months.</p>

          <p>While we never imagined onboarding to a new job virtually, we are happy to report that things are going just smooth in the new normal. As we were located in different parts of India and our team is thousands of miles away from us in Europe, we felt much pressure - sometimes worrying if we made the right decision or not, by changing jobs when the whole world was in COVID-19 and the financial crisis. </p>
          <p>SMO Management and HR team have released all pressure in the first week by caring for their new employees. Planned virtual sessions like All Hand meetings, Buddy Talks, talks with CIO, Daily standups, Weekly team meetings, Jour Fixes, and German coaching helped build positive momentum in all teams to work together. </p>
          <p>Provided were one-time amount to set up home office furniture and IT accessories, few Yoga and workout sessions considering employee health and comfort.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>Good planning for knowledge sharing sessions and keeping breathing space between the sessions to digest the knowledge was essential. Also, there was enough overlap in Passive and Active shadowing with the ATOS Team to completely and successfully take over the ownership of the SMO MCAD support services starting from 1st January 2021.</p>
          <p>Insourcing will help us to take more ownership, raise flexibility, improve collaboration, lower overall cost and support our Business Units in a better way. Plans for the future are currently a major PLM system upgrade and the implementation of Teamcenter as our new PLM platform. Thank you to every member of SMO to make this Journey successful ❤</p>

            2020 has been that one year that has taught us the importance of the above quote. It has completely changed the way most of us work. Our relationships with our colleagues have been redefined. Going for lunch together, having a cup of tea at the local tapri, celebrating birthdays – usually, these were the moments that helped us grow from a group of individuals to a team. Covid-19 has prevented us from enjoying such real-life moments, and it seems it might continue to do so for a while. However, this does not mean that we stop growing and connecting.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>The initial days of work from home were a huge adjustment, but we all learned to adapt ourselves. As part of this journey, we moved our day-to-day practices from the real world to this virtual world. Being part of a team meant a lot of things. A day in the office for our team generally started with the daily scrum meeting. Our first order of business was to conduct this online. Tracking this in such a way that the status is visible to all the stakeholders was very important. </p>
          <p>We now have a daily 15-minute standup conducted by our Scrum Master, wherein each team member gives an update of the task they are working on using the RTC dashboard. In the absence of the scrum master, any team member steps up to conduct the same. This is true for all the agile ceremonies such as the Sprint review, Sprint retrospective and backlog grooming. </p>

          <p>It has been a continuous learning process to time box ourselves. However, we feel that the daily standup is essential for us as this is a required human connection we need to kick start our day.</p>
          <p>During the past year, we also had a successful release. This would not have been possible without the entire team's joint effort. In the beginning, it was a bit overwhelming to figure out how to work together virtually. We had a bit of a shaky start, but finally, we set ourselves a new rhythm.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>
            We learnt to break the tasks down into smaller stories to achieve better sprint velocity, spend more time in understanding the requirements together so that we could work on them individually, squinted away at the fine print of a screen shared during a call to discuss and debug solutions all the while keeping the goal of the release in mind. Siemens also ensured that we could grow individually by giving us access to different pieces of training and certifications. Team members have completed various activities such as IMS, AI/ML, etc.
          </p>
          <p>Being at home unable to interact with others does take its toll, though. Different people went through different emotional upheavals. However, we have always tried to maintain an open communication line, be it among ourselves or with our managers. We had talks wherein each team member openly spoke about the difficulties and challenges they were facing, and we tried figuring out how we could make things better for them. Every day we have a DND ( Do not disturb) time zone wherein we keep aside an hour roughly. It is the me-time for each individual wherein he/she is free to do whatever they want. It could be completing some housework, resting for some time or even just completing an individual task without having anyone disturb them at that time.</p>

          <p>No matter how big or small, we should celebrate and appreciate occasions and people.</p>

At the same time, we have had many other reasons to celebrate, be it birthdays, marriages, anniversaries or births, we have been blessed. Not being able to celebrate in the office together did not stop us, however. Every birthday is celebrated with a small video filled with wishes and funny moments. We get together on call and sing Happy Birthday ( though we still haven't learnt how to sing together 😉 ) and pull each other's legs.</p>
         
          <p>Even though we are cities apart, we still feel the team spirit which is very apparent during our celebrations and fun sessions. It's been a huge learning curve to learn to live in this new normal, but the journey together as a team has made it worth it. Signing off. Team MCR EP.</p>

            Vehicle-Actuated Signals
          </h1>
          <div class="info__main-content">
            <p>Traffic congestion is becoming a critical issue day by day, and this is due to the increase in urbanization, industries, and vehicles. Sometimes emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks are stuck in traffic and unable to reach in time for rescue. </p>

            <p>The worst traffic jams or long queues occur at intersections where cars, bikes, buses, or pedestrians cross the road. If we can manage traffic at such intersections, we might resolve this issue significantly. Almost all big cities have traffic signals and a dedicated traffic police force for managing everyday traffic. In case of emergencies, the police can use a traffic control panel to make dynamic signal changes or take control over intersection traffic manually.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
            <p>
            "Vehicle-Actuated Signals" is one of the preferred methods for optimizing intersection traffic. There are also various detectors used for actuation. e.g., inductive loop detectors, radar, RFID, or cameras. 
            </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="newTheme/img/traffic.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Signal controller programs take these detector actuations as input from all approach lanes and dynamically adjust the signal timing plan and reduce queue length on all lanes as much as possible. These steps help reduce congestion time significantly. Some cities have preferred special vehicle detection mechanisms to detect emergency vehicles and public transport vehicles to prioritize cross intersections. </p> 

          <p>Typically, traffic signal controllers operate in three modes.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p><strong>Pre-Timed Signal:</strong> In this mode, a traffic signal's Green-Amber-Red timing is fixed, and these patterns are repeated throughout the day. Sometimes, these fixed timing partners or designs are based on historical traffic scenarios. An example can be giving more time to the green signals in the morning, especially those that lead to offices or industrial areas. This will ensure the smooth movement of traffic.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Actuated Signal:</strong>  In this method, one can use vehicle detectors to detect traffic based on queue length, vehicle type, and priority; based on these factors, signal controllers can optimize signal timing dynamically. Taking the same scenario as above, if there is more traffic moving towards the office or industrial area, a lane could get maximum green time dynamically.</p>

          <p><strong>Mixed-Mode:</strong>   One can use this mode at major and minor traffic road junctions. Typically, major roads have fixed timing, and minor roads get actuated signals. By doing this, minor roads will get a green signal when there is sizable traffic. Otherwise, you end up prioritizing just major-road traffic.</p>

            Advantages of Actuated Signals
          </h3>

            <li>They can reduce congestion/delay (if properly timed).</li>
            <li>They are adaptable to short-term fluctuations in traffic flow.</li>

            Disadvantages of Actuated Signals
          </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If the traffic demand pattern is very regular, the extra benefit of adding local actuation is minimal or non-existent.</li>
              <li>Installation cost is two to three times the cost of a pre-timed signal installation.</li>
              <li>Actuated controllers are much more complicated than pre-timed controllers, increasing maintenance costs.</li>
              <li>They require careful inspection & maintenance to ensure proper operation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Traffic engineers are coming up with newer concepts like Signal Synchronization, which allows coordinating traffic signals along a single route so that vehicles get a progressive green signal at each junction. This is another crucial aspect that we will discuss more in the upcoming newsletter.     </p>

            Magnification in train control system
          </h3>
          <div class="info__main-content">
            <p>Metro Signalling & Train control system technology focus means of reducing headway, ensuring safety, and improving efficiency and reduction in the cost of operation. The Signalling & Train Control system on Main Line Railways and Metros are different on account of very different traffic requirements besides civil and E&M infrastructure. Signalling & Train Control in metros not only ensures train safety, but it also integrates, interfaces, and automates areas of operation, driving, passenger information, collection of information, and analysis of the same. Signalling & Train Control systems have been dominated using Track Circuit-based Signalling & Train Control for more than five decades.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          
          <p>The success of Metro rail systems lies in their ability to provide frequent, fast, safe, and comfortable journeys in the urban conglomeration, not only to the regular commuters but also to the occasional traveler or tourist alike. Signalling and Train Control systems play a major role in achieving these objectives. While enhancing operational efficiency by providing control systems to achieve the target headway, it also always ensures the total safety of the train movements besides adding value to other systems by the on-line interface.</p>
          <p>The rapid developments in the computer and microcircuit technology, as well as telecommunication, have led to the development of Integrated Metro Control systems, in which computers (including failsafe forms of computers) fulfill many of the decision making roles traditionally performed by Train operators, station controllers, Traffic controllers, etc., eventually leading to the introduction of highly automated Metro Rail with driverless trains.</p>
          </p>
          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Need for Train detection and methods used: </h3>
          <p>To convey information to a train about where to stop and at what speed to run required all the trains on any line to be detected automatically by the system. This was achieved by the invention of the so-called “track circuits”. Track circuits were first invented in the USA (DC Track circuits) in 1872 and later picked up and improved by British railways. London Underground was the first large-scale user in a Metro rail network 1904-06. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
           <p>The need to provide information to train resulted in the invention of “coded track circuits” with modulation of a basic AC carrier with codes. These required insulated joints between sections of rails like earlier track circuits for demarcating the individual track circuit blocks. Later came to the “jointless track circuits” which use audio frequencies and provide high impedance between adjacent track circuits by a tuning process thus avoiding the need for insulated joints. These are commonly called Audio frequency Track Circuits (AFTC) and these help in transmitting codes that modulate the basic AFTC carrier which in turn are picked up by an antenna suspended below the train. </p>
          <p>In addition to track circuits, another system called “axle counter” is also used for train detection. In this method, axles are detected through a magnetic circuit linking a transmitter and a receiver across the rail, and whenever a metallic axle interposes the received signal drops are detected and counted as one pulse. In this manner, all the axles coming into one block are counted at the entry and if all the axles are counted out at the exit of the block the block is declared as clear. </p>
          <p>In the latest advancement in Metro signalling, a system called Communication based train control (CBTC) has been in use for more than a decade. In this system, the primary train detection is purely based on a failsafe communication link between the train and the control center with the train communicating its position continuously and the control Centre communicates the position to other trains for maintaining the safety distance between two trains. Track circuits or axle counters if any are used only as a secondary detection in case the Metro operator desires a fallback system.</p>

            Characteristics of Communication-Based Train Control System (CBTC)
          </h3>
          <p>Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a railway signalling system that makes use of the telecommunications between the train and track equipment for traffic management and train control. CBTC systems enable, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signalling systems, which results more efficiently and safely to manage the railway traffic and improve headway.</p>
          <p>CBTC systems allow different levels of automation or Grades of Automation, GoA, as classified in the IEC 62290-1. CBTC is not a synonym for “driverless” or “automated trains” although it is considered as a basic technology for this purpose.</p>

          <p>Driverless Train Operation (DTO) and Unattended Train Operation (UTO): 
          More sophisticated systems free the driver from the need to be at the front of the train – referred to as Driverless Train Operation (DTO) or GOA level 3. In DTO the driver can move away from the front of the train but remains available to provide customer-facing duties and to drive the train in the event of a failure of the DTO/ATO system. </p>
          <p>As the driver is no longer able to see the route ahead this imposes a greater demand on guideway security and platform controls. Platform screen doors must be provided, to allow ATO to handle door closing also on the signal from ATP that all the Platform Screen Doors have closed fully. </p>
          <p>In DTO, train doors and train departure from a station platform may also be controlled automatically or manually from a location other than a driver cab at the front of the train. ATO can be given the operating instructions by the ATS regarding dwell time and hold for regulating the train on platforms as required by the operational situation and in the normal course, the driver wherever he happens to be on the train is relieved of all operational workload. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">

          <p>CCTV information of the inside of coaches is transmitted live in new systems to OCC for controllers to observe for any untoward incidents inside the moving train and with other advancements in prevention and detection of unauthorized access to the viaduct or tunnel, even a separate train operator is no longer required on the cab in the train. The space required for the equipment could also be saved and passenger capacity increased at the end cabs. Thus, it became possible to have an Unattended Train Operation. Driverless ATO without an on-board attendant is referred to as Unattended Train Operation (UTO) or GOA level 4. UTO can range from empty train movements ( only to a siding, or in an automated depot, for example) to the operation of trains in passenger service with no attendant on board. The latter requires that the reliability of the systems has to be of a higher level and the train can be operated remotely under failure conditions, or at the minimum can be reached by shore-based personal in a short period. Passengers need to be reassured and hence good communication and CCTV links between the vehicle and an informed staff member at OCC or a specified location are essential.</p>

            Risks of CBTC
          </h3>
          <p>The primary risk of a CBTC system is that if the communications link between any of the trains is disrupted then all or part of the system might have to enter a failsafe state until the problem is remedied. Depending on the severity of the communication loss, this state can range from vehicles temporarily reducing speed, coming to a halt, or operating in a degraded mode until communications are re-established.</p>
          <p>Communications failures can result from equipment malfunction, electromagnetic interference, weak signal strength or saturation of the communications medium. In this case, an interruption can result in a service brake or emergency brake application as real-time situational awareness is a critical safety requirement for CBTC and if these interruptions are frequent enough it could seriously impact service.</p>
          <p>Cyber-physical challenge is the severe risk in this system. CBTC Systems that make use of open standards for wireless digital communications link have a much larger attack surface and can be subject to various types of hacking including intrusion of the communications network and tampering with safety-critical messages that, in the worst case, could result in a safety hazard.</p>
          <p>CBTC systems may be designed with centralized supervision systems, to improve maintainability and reduce installation costs. If so, there is an increased risk of a single point of failure that could disrupt service over an entire system or line.</p>

            Domain Dictionary Journey
          </h3>
          <p>
            We have started our ourney with comprehensive list of mobility domain jargons. We used to go through different document for understanding those jargons wchi was very specific to product. Hence we alway struggled to know about terminologies used in differnt product. We have also found that there are wiki and SharePoint Protal where some product terminologies are stored. These experiences gave us a problem statement:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>"A common platform which will have of terminologies used in mobility domains".</strong>

            IP Generation
          </h3>
          <p>According to me, innovation is creating something new or capturing some value-added ideas in a product/project/business for a specific problem statement. Innovation can be completely radical sometimes and sometimes just an improvement/enhancement. Innovation, which is non-obvious and novel in nature, is qualified for the IP. I always like to do innovation, and for that, I always try to observe problems in the system as a whole. Whenever a valid problem statement is identified, then I work towards its solution. For me, innovation benefitted in different ways; most importantly, it allows learning and deeply understanding the product/project/domain. Innovation also helps to create synergy between the teams, and sometimes innovation also helps to accelerate the product growth as per the market need.</p>
          <p>According to me, innovation culture is there in Siemens from the start, and management always tries to motivate and push people towards this topic. This culture defines siemens as a better place to work and helps to act as a better player. Some teams in various regions want to concentrate more on product deliveries because of which currently there are limited innovators in siemens, so if everyone starts making innovation as part of their work, more people will start pushing themself for this topic and become inventors/innovators.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,</p>
            <p>I am K. Sakthisubramanian, joined as the Head of Engineering in the COBRA team. Being a part of the COBRA team where growth and development are the main goals, how it would be correct if GROWTH is not been voiced by me. So, I would like to share some thoughts and concepts of GROWTH in this article for everybody’s knowledge sake.</p>

        <p>The growth of an organization is not possible without having a strong goal, leadership with a vision and an enthusiastic team even if the funds are available.  Hence, when we talk about the growth of an organization it has the growth of the individuals in it which leads us to get a strong team with leader.</p> 
        <p>Every time when I hear about “GROWTH”, the first think which relates to me is the MINDSET.  The growth MINDSET which is a must need for the GROWTH of organization, individual career etc.,</p>  
        <p>The growth Mindset basically is about the way how every situation can be improved better through the previous experiences, lessons learnt and practice.  With a growth mindset the failure is not considered as a detriment rather it is considered as a one more step taken closer to the success.  </p>
        <p>With the Growth mindset the organization and the individuals in the organization should start cultivating a strong culture of learning from every situation as the growth is a natural consequence of learning.  Regular discussions on the performances of the individuals need to be performed by the managers.  Leaders need to focus mainly on valuing the employee’s contributions, suggestions, feedback in order to route to the success. There should be opportunities provided for the talent improvements of the individuals and time for getting innovative ideas in order to reach the success. Following the growth mindset is a “change in progress” in order to reach every new goals of the organization.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>Having a growth mindset and willing to take new opportunities / risks to excel the career are the main requirements for the success of every individuals.  Putting the best efforts in line to reach the targets will take you to success.  The individual success will always move into the path of career growth.</p>
          <p>Let me tell a short story of my life which leads to success.</p>
          <p>“I started my career as a trainee in 2004 at a HitachiRail company (earlier it was known as USS) in Bangalore, after a couple of months theoretical training on railway signaling  which includes 2 weeks of training in the Indian railway institute (IRISET). </p>
          <p>I was assigned as a site engineer in Allahabad, UP.  Having a little knowledge on signaling and products also being a born and brought up from a small town in Tamil nadu (a state from down south of India and my hometown is near to Kanyakumari the south end of India) first time I have to move to a different state which is around 2311KMs from my native where we don’t have an office and I don’t know anyone.  
          I am the only kid for my parents and need to leave them alone in which case my dad is a heart patient who had just got a cardiac arrest a couple of months ago.</p>

         <p> Considering that after a year of my learning I will get an opportunity to move back myself to the design office in Bangalore (which is comparatively close to my native) however, I got another challenge as I got transferred to Firozpur, Punjab(near to the Pakistan Border)as a site manager(in-charge) based on my good performances in Allahabad.</p> <p>However, this was a challenge for me in my personal life as I have to further travel 1100 kms towards the north but considering it as an opportunity to prove myself further in a next level as a site in charge I went to Punjab and succeeded in that assignment as well.  Based on my performances and capabilities of independently handling the local contractors, customers and managing the site activities which includes the verification of the design during testing and commissioning, I got the opportunity to work on the biggest project KFW (in 2006).  Once I entered the KFW project I concentrated on design and proved myself on the design capabilities by placing myself in Noida office for around 6 years sacrificing my expectations to work in Bangalore.  My goal and my growth mindset doesn’t get stopped, it continued and made me come across all the hurdles before me and placed me in a lot of positions from Design engineer, Team leader, Work Package Leader,  Design Manager, etc., and officially to reach as the Head of Metro Application India in 2019 in HitachRail.</p>

          <p>Still today I am in the learning phase and always ready to take opportunities as I was in 2004. My recent opportunity which I took over is the one that made me join SIEMENS, Pune as “Head of Engineering – COBRA””.</p>
          <p>Every individual team member is informed to consider the growth mindset as an important tool to get yourselves to your targets.  Nobody can stop you when you are ready to move towards your GROWTH with a growth mindset. </p>

            <p>The term RAMS, apart from meaning Random Access Memory, also stands for Reliability Availability Maintainability and Safety, of which I am a member. The newborn team in Siemens Mobility is an active bunch of validators and safety engineers. We specialize in validation- and safety-related activities. This means we stamp the products that are fit and safe to use for railway applications. We are also invaluable when it comes to Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) and Customer Acceptance Assessments. </p>
            
            <p>While our early RAMS activities are confined to projects in the UK, our validation activities have been picked for projects in Germany and Spain. </p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
          <p>RAMS has grown phenomenally during the course of a year, from a one-member team to nine members today. This is all thanks to the continuous efforts and successful deliveries of assigned projects. The team always strives to find the balance between the project constraints and RAMS aspects which is no easy task to achieve. Our team drives on 3Cs - Competency, Collaboration, and Communication.  The competency aspect of the team is not only taken care of with keen and considerate criteria for eligibility but also periodic nurturing within the team through Knowledge Sharing Sessions (KSS). </p>

         <p>These sessions contain learnings from specific projects, discussion of concepts, and introduction of techniques. Collaboration is done by offering training to fellow teams on EN standards, RAMS topics, and validation aspects. At Advanta level, the collaboration is reflected in our support to their safety-related queries as most teams find it hard to find the safety relatedness of their project’s or product’s functionality. Communication plays a key role in our work profile. It’s the medium for successful and smooth competency development and collaboration. </p>

              "Skill" & "Competence" are buzzwords in all talent centric industries across the world, including Mobility. While importance attached to it is understood, there are limited avenues to holistically understand it as is vs futuristic state. Organizations define tangible goals for growth, but this area lacked enough focus to measure the goals! That’s where a focused competence development & management approach garnered such significance in these times. In the Mobility industry, safety is an important objective for organizations. Standards like EN50128 (approved by CENELEC), ISO9001 & IEC61508 make it necessary to demonstrate & manage the competence of personnel, apart from stringent quality aspects.

          <p>Sensing this need, a competence management system, Talevo (erstwhile CMS) was conceptualized & developed inhouse by Pune Mobility team members. What started as an idea thread, has evolved into a system which was rolled out in Pune Mobility team in Oct’20 and is being rolled out to various departments across Mobility, Siemens. 
          <p>Talevo allows building a strategic talent management approach to define and track the competencies required for successfully delivering an organization’s business strategy. With this strategy, you can answer the following questions:</p>

          <p>These are the challenges that the management at SMO DT IT HUB IN was trying to solve. Much to our fortune, the Siemens Advanta team came up with a product that addresses these concerns while bringing both employees and managers in close alignment. And thus, the Talevo journey started for SMO DT IT HUB in India.</p>

          <p>Talevo is an in-house developed competency management system based on CENELAC standard and Master competency definition. It provides a clear framework of skills, application knowledge, and (behavior) abilities that employees must meet to fulfill their job expectations and contribute to the company's success. This product is developed to ensure competencies are captured, tracked, and updated in a transparent and easy way to help the site, department, and employees succeed. Talevo is an instrument to uncover gaps in the current state and empower users for quicker decisions to realize the organization’s vision. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
         <p>The rollout for Talevo in SMO DT IT HUB started on November 1st, 2020, and the date of handover to operations was decided as 15th February 2021. Within these timelines, all the modules comprising employee profile management, competency-based employee search, competency management, and competency review were scheduled to be completed. The HUB management decided to delegate the responsibility of Talevo Rollout to two project managers, Bhunesh Bhaskar & Abhishek Tripathi, from the Infrastructure Services team headed by Samarth Karnekar. </p>

          <p>Since both these project managers had recently joined the organization, it was a great opportunity for them to showcase their project management skills. This rollout also gave them an opportunity to connect with their colleagues and team managers from different verticals within the HUB. Dividing all the activities into parallel work packages and adherence to timelines meant that the rollout was completed well within the given timeline. Post the successful implementation of this competency management system other business units and teams have started adopting the tool with the help of SMO DT IT HUB as a role model.</p>

            <p>Every year, we have been conducting this “Share Happiness” event before Diwali for all our
            support staff. As they take care of the cleanliness, maintenance, and security of the office and
            offer us a pleasant work environment.</p>
            <p>So on this day, our teammates take all roles & responsibilities (security, reception, washrooms,
            pantry etc.) from the support staff for few hours and conduct this event to provide them some
            break from their routine, conduct a few fun-activities, serve them good food and facilitate them
            Along-with some gifts-n-goodies. Even during this challenging time, we managed to celebrate this
            the event in a different format.</p>

            <p>In March 2020, we decided that it’s not a question of whether
            we ‘can’ or not pull this off but a question of ‘how’ we should
            pull this off. Together, we decided that we’d set a completely
            virtual team of the MO-IT India Hub–even when it was an
            unexplored path for us.</p>
            <p>Now that I look back, I can say with certainty that we took the
            right decision. In close cooperation with the local HR and talent
            acquisition team, with the help of innovative IT solutions, we
            succeeded in conducting 500+ virtual job interviews. Through
            that, we onboarded 40 colleagues in less than 6 months.
            However, onboarding our colleagues were just the beginning.
            The real challenge was to cultivate team-spirit and smoothen
            collaboration in a team that’s never even seen each other.</p>
            <p>To address this, we at Siemens Mobility IT India Hub
            started multiple initiatives to boost interaction. We started
            with the buddy-program wherein a buddy was assigned to every
            new member to interact with and to reach out for help.
            In addition to that, we chalked out a 50/100 days plan for
            each individual to help them focus their efforts in the right
            direction. To further aid our new colleagues, we organized
            multiple knowledge transfer sessions from industry experts.
            Lastly, to ease their relationship with their team members and
            foster a feeling of togetherness, we organized virtual
            get-togethers, monthly team events, family appreciation
            meets, German language lessons.</p>
            <ul class="page-indicators page-indicators--blue page-indicators--static">
              <li></li>
              <li></li>
              <li class="active"></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 info__col">
            <p>Our efforts bore fruits sooner than we had expected. Within 3
            months of joining, most of our new colleagues were able to take
            on responsibilities in various areas such as ERP activities, PLM
            space, global infrastructure, and CRM projects.</p>
            <p>We have several other initiatives planned to continue building
            the spirit of collaboration within the team. All our efforts are
            towards a shared vision: to seamlessly integrate into the global
            team and enable Mobility IT to grow by providing additional
            capacity and relevant expertise.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, we aim to deliver innovative and high-quality
            products and become a trusted business partner. By building a
            team of more than 40 people fully virtually in less than 6
            months we demonstrated capabilities to “walk the talk” at
            Mobility IT India Hub.</p>
            <p>We’ve established that we deliver on our commitments and we
            grow stronger together. A testament to this is the fact that we
            have been receiving countless referrals from our new team
            members for open positions at the Hub. Clearly, our comrades
            are enjoying the environment we’ve built and trust us enough to
            help us grow by recommending suitable profiles.
