We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to other companies or people under any of the following circumstances:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>to any applicable venue, studio, instructor, or other service provider for each class or activity that you sign up for on the Site.</li>\r\n          <li>if sharing the information is reasonably necessary to provide a service that you have requested.</li>\r\n          <li>to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information we think you would like to know about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications).</li>\r\n          <li>if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law, in connection with litigation, to prevent a crime, or to protect personal property, the public, or the Site.</li>\r\n          <li>in connection with a sale or merger with another entity or if Fitato should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to another company and/or any other entity.</li>\r\n          <li>for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement.</li>\r\n          <li>when we otherwise have your consent to share the information.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>Fitato may also share non-Personally Identifiable Information with third parties (e.g. aggregate or demographic data).</p>\r\n        <p>Granting us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide Fitato as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.</p>\r\n        <p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above.

We encourage our users to be aware when leaving the Site to read the privacy statements of each site that collects Personally Identifiable Information.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Cookies</h2>\r\n        <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our behalf. These companies may use a cookie or an action tag, also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file, to tailor the advertisements you see on this Website and other sites, to track your response to their advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of their advertising or to award incentives or points to their members who respond to their advertisements. The cookies, action tags or similar files do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>\r\n        <p>We may also receive information about you from other sources or third parties and add it to the information you provide us. For example, we may collect information from credit reporting agencies and other third parties to authenticate your purchase or for risk management purposes. If you decide at any point that you no longer wish to receive messages of this nature, please contact us and send an email at <a href=\"mailto:suppport@fitato.fit\">suppport@fitato.fit</a> to let us know.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Your Consent to this Privacy Policy</h2>\r\n        <p>By using this Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions beyond India where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to:</p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity;</li>\r\n          <li>to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations;</li>\r\n          <li>or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Change of Control</h2>\r\n        <p>If the ownership of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so they can continue to operate the service. But they will still have to honour the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n        <p>We at Fitato have adopted the highest standards of security and encryption techniques to protect your sensitive information. However, in case any personal information belonging to you is accessed by any unlawful interference or circumvention by a third party, Fitato does not assume any liability with respect to the same.</p>\r\n        <p>This Privacy Policy is not exhaustive and may be amended from time to time.</p>\r\n        <p>You agree that you have carefully gone through this Privacy Policy and have read and understood and contents thereof before using our products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Contacting Fitato</h2>\r\n        <p>If You have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>\r\n        <p>Fitato<br />Fitato Health Solutions Private Limited<br />7 E2, Liberty Phase 2, Koregoan Park, Pune 411 001<br />+ 91 8390230124</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <FooterInfo />\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default PrivacyPolicyPage\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport { withPrefix } from 'gatsby'\r\n\r\nconst SocialLinks = props => (\r\n  <ul className={props.cname}>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Fitato.fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n        <img src={withPrefix('/static/icons/facebook-circle-black.svg')} alt=\"facebook\" className=\"partial-social-links__icon\" />\r\n      </a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FitatoFit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n        <img src={withPrefix('/static/icons/twitter-circle-black.svg')} alt=\"twitter\" className=\"partial-social-links__icon\" />\r\n      </a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+FitatoFitness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n        <img src={withPrefix('/static/icons/google-plus-square-black.svg')} alt=\"google plus\" className=\"partial-social-links__icon\" />\r\n      </a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAcO5m8nXxqXHs42kyfzmg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n        <img src={withPrefix('/static/icons/youtube-circle-black.svg')} alt=\"youtube\" className=\"partial-social-links__icon\" />\r\n      </a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fitato_fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\r\n        <img src={withPrefix('/static/icons/instagram-circle-black.svg')} alt=\"instagram\" className=\"partial-social-links__icon\" />\r\n      </a>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default SocialLinks","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nconst ContactLinks = props => (\r\n  <ul className={props.cname}>\r\n    <li><a href=\"mailto:connect@fitato.fit\">connect@fitato.fit</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"tel:+918200396237\">+91 8200396237</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n);\r\n\r\nexport default ContactLinks","import React from 'react'\r\nimport { Link, withPrefix } from 'gatsby'\r\nimport SocialLinks from './SocialLinks'\r\nimport ContactLinks from './ContactLinks'\r\n\r\nconst FooterInfo = () => (\r\n  <div className=\"footer-info\" style={{backgroundImage: 'url(' + withPrefix('/static/footer-bg.webp') + ')'}}>\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n      <div className=\"footer-info__col1\">\r\n        <h4>Do You Own a Fitness Facility?
