        <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
 
        <p>Welcome to the 7th edition of Mobility Pune Newsletter. As we close out financial year 2021, we can look back and feel proud of what we have achieved together in a highly challenging environment. This edition is a tribute to our spirit of being #InThisTogether.</p>
        <p>As per tradition we have leadership messages from Nikhil, Maik & Prasad. We have Mr Vikram Deshpande , Segment Head , Smart Buildings as the guest contributor with words of wisdom from Dr Nadkarni.</p>
        <p>In addition to Project Spaces, Technology Corner & Trivia this time we have a Business Excellence community providing greater insights into the work they do. We have embarked on a journey of overcoming the challenge not just by sustaining but by taking up greater challenges. Advanta Mobility went through CMMI Level 3 (CMMI V2.0) assessment & successful certification in a compressed timeline. We celebrate this achievement. </p>

        <p>In organization updates we talk about PSS (Product Solution & Security) group which is one of the key offerings of Mobility Pune.This edition covers PSS from Advanta Mobility perspective . </p>
        <p>The Product Management Forum is a new initiative at Advanta Mobility to deepen our understanding of Product Management.</p>

        </p>

        <p>Out of the box section was introduced in the previous edition to talk about initiatives, programs that has taken a path different than the trodden path. In this edition we look at Know Your Key Experts (KYKE) initiative from Advanta Mobility Team and  Know Your Colleagues initiative by COBRA team.</p>

 
        <p>A large number of people from all the three Mobility groups in Pune contribute to make the Newsletter possible, hopefully interesting & readable. A big shout out to all the contributors. We welcome your feedback and look forward to your contributions in the next edition.</p>
 

        <p>Wishing you all a happy festive season.</p>

          <p><strong>#InThisTogether</strong> we have provided the best support wherever possible, here are a few highlights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>50+</strong> Volunteers formed the <strong>Covid-19 Support Group</strong> to assist COVID struck employees/family members across India </li>
            <li><strong>Surveys</strong> are conducted to understand the overall picture and extend support to the urgent needs</li>
            <li>A small team of Volunteers lead the topics like ambulances, labs, hospital connections etc.</li>
            <li><strong>1760</strong> employees and family members vaccinated at the company site</li>
            <li><strong>#MyCowinStory</strong> - Positivity Podcasts by employees who bravely overcame COVID inflicted illness.</li>
            <li>These podcasts are available on Yammer at “MyCoWinStory Podcast”</li>
            <li>Leadership connects, response & ongoing support to ensure calm & hope is maintained amongst all team members.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>From a company perspective, #InThisTogether is much more than a support group. It is an effort to help our employees during a ‘once-in-a-century’ pandemic. One of the key efforts of this initiative was to provide vaccination to our employees. As we all know by now, getting vaccinated is important for us to get out of this pandemic as soon as possible.</p> 

          <p>To ensure that our employees have access to the vaccine, we launched a vaccination drive in early 2021. This COVID-19 vaccination drive covered 20+ cities all over the country and we were able to vaccinate 13,000 people in a short span of time! In Pune itself 1760 of our employees were able to get the vaccine easily.</p>

          
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>All this has been made possible because of the efforts of our volunteers and the support of our employees who cooperated to make the vaccination drive a success.</p>
          
          <p>Another area of  focus of our #InThisTogether initiative was to bring our employees closer together. With the physical offices closed because of the pandemic and social distancing, social isolation was a big hurdle to overcome. To top it off, we were surrounded by negative news and events during the peak of the second wave in early 2021. </p>

          <p>To combat this, we launched the #MyCowinStory podcast. These positivity podcasts featured SIEMENS employees who overcame COVID-19 and shared their stories with us. We got a chance to hear how they fought isolation, illness, and negative thoughts with the help of their family, loved ones and sheer resilience. </p>


          <p>Such stories inspired everyone and reinforced a sense of positivity and morale during a very difficult time for most. We are thankful to everyone who shared their experiences with us and also to those who tuned in to the podcasts. While the pandemic may be ongoing, it is important to remember that we are #InThisTogether and with the right support we can tide over the tough times soon.</p>

          <p>In its simplest form, a Growth Talk is purely a future-focused exchange between people that results in learning and progress toward a goal. The shared objectives of all exchanges is to be development-oriented and performance enhancing.</p>

          <p>Faster business cycles and new challenges demand a growth mindset—staying curious, being resilient, experimenting, and adapting. To strengthen our performance through individual growth​, we need a mindset change.</p> 

          <p>We replace our system-driven annual processes with engaging, jointly-driven conversations that focus on individual growth and drive business success. These conversations and exchanges can be approached in many different ways, depending on the situation. This is the Growth Talks approach.</p>

        <p>Our efforts last year were to bring everyone closer together and create an engaging and supportive environment in difficult times. Right from our vaccination drive to Growth Talks, these have just been a starting point for the great things to come in 2022, Stay Tuned!</p>

        <p>As we are closing the loose ends of FY21 and embarking on FY22 , I am fascinated as I reflect on transformative experiences over last year and more!</p>
        <p>This has certainly helped in our endeavor to take more responsibility and ownership to make SIEMENS competitive. Now we have 6 Global Project Managers, 5 Process Owners, 5 Software Architects, 4 Product Managers, 2 Product Owners, 1 System Architect, and 1 "Method Owner" driving multiple topics from ADVANTA Mobility India.</p>

        <p>SIEMENS Vaccination drive pan India has been fantastic, including extremely smooth drive at Pune. This drive has truly demonstrated the spirit of #InThisTogether across multiple entities and departments in India. #MyCoWinStory podcasts encouraged employees to share their stories of overcoming COVID challenges. Employee participation in mental well-being programs have been heartening.</p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>During these times, the biggest challenge that we are facing is the TALENT WAR situation in India. I deeply appreciate the different actions that the management team has taken to address the situation, including the unprecedented decision to give multiple bonuses in addition to the  salary hike effective 1st October.</p>

        <p>We have conducted a series of online games, “Mushaira”, Toastmasters session, Town Halls, Gemba Walks, Growth Talks, Tech Breaks, MOTO lab and 1-2-1 sessions to name a few. In spite of persistent efforts from different quarters, the talent acquisition and retention situation have been exigent.</p>

        <p> We will have to respond to “Phigital world” differently. It has raised stakes for us to engage each other by expanding options through experimentation and learning.</p>
        <p>Please note that we are introducing a series of “AskMeAnything” starting with Frank Gerken. Stay tuned!</p>
        <p>Bring in your ideas, we need to handle the situation together!</p>

        <p>I can say proudly that as of today, there are more than 40 services where IT HUB is a part of and are getting delivered to all SMO BUs and this number is bound to go up in FY22. We have invested significantly this year on learning and development programs to enable our colleagues to take on new challenges.</p>
        <p>Talking about challenges, there are certain key decisions taken by SAG in FY20 and FY 21 which directly affected SMO IT. First was to re-integrate with SAG and second was having governance reporting to IT. With these decisions, we as IT HUB had to redesign our strategy to suit the current organizational structure and demand to continue supporting future growth for SMO as a business. We have many key projects such as PLM implementation, SHERPA, SASCIA etc. in our horizon and we need to build the skills and the capacity to support these complex projects for having an impact on the entire Mobility business.</p>
   
        <p>Though the pandemic is not over yet, the situation as of today has much improved as compared to last quarter, thanks to the efforts of all relevant agencies, volunteers and Siemens. As IT HUB will be co-locating with COBRA team for office space, we took this opportunity to inaugurate our new office located in Cummins campus after taking all the recommended precautions.</p>

        <p> COBRA and IT HUB management teams were present at the event and meeting colleagues face to face for the first time after a year and half was truly a wonderful experience. We sincerely hope that the pandemic situation will improve and it will allow us more such interactions in the near future.</p>
        
        <p>I would like to thank all of you who made this IT HUB journey of the last one and half years possible and look forward to many more such opportunities. Wish everyone all the very best for FY22.</p>

        <p> However, although the operational interaction is going smoothly working from remote, the lack of real social interaction will likely be taking its toll in the long run. I still believe that you can only develop a real bonding and team spirit if colleagues meet in person at least once in a while and a bit more in the beginning.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the COBRA management team took the initiative and held the first Cobra line management face-to-face workshop ever in Bengaluru from July 29 to 30. I have to admit that I was really excited to see most of my managers for the first time after more than a year. Sanjay and Anuj I knew from the past, but Sakthi, Raij and Sai I have never met before. Only Kay and Niko, who are still in Germany, had to dial in. All being routine business people, we realized that we had become a bit “rusty”. I couldn’t remember when it was the last time that I wore a shirt. Others said it took them ages to pack their bag for these 2 days because things that were at hand all the time in the past now had disappeared somewhere in drawers because they were not used anymore.</p>
        <p>But it was not just about meeting face to face. We had many topics to discuss, mostly related to our staff. Again we discussed possible concepts for the new normal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p> The employee survey results and how to address them properly were also on the agenda, just to mention a few topics. Some of the results will be presented during our upcoming online management information session.</p>
        <p> We also had the opportunity to meet and interact with the project team of BMRCL, and we appreciate their efforts despite the pandemic and the current challenges in the project. </p>
        <p>Overall it was a great experience after such a long time, and I hope that all of us will be getting the opportunity to meet in person soon.</p>

The two key characteristics that have helped us to overcome such events are spirit of resilience and social collaboration.

        <p>My #InThisTogether moment, was in the second wave, which was much severe than the first as we all experienced. In the beginning, all of us were grappling with fear, anxiety, medical emergencies and hospital shortages, and individually we were quite helpless. But this transpired into a small community #CovidSupportGroup, at Pune, that was created as a voluntary support group, to help and facilitate those in need, in whichever way possible. <p>
        <p>It was beautiful to see people coming together, using all available resources, to help find a hospital bed, or to get the number of the dealer with medicines, or book a covid test for a colleague or their family or even small financial help for those in need. As individuals we were quite helpless, but collectively, we were able to overcome many of the challenges. This was a collaboration beyond the boundaries of organizations, or regions, we saw people from Smart Buildings, Mobility, Mobility IT , SOP IT, as well the MO Engineering coming together and offering support and resources that were available to them.</p>
        <p>  I got so many emails from colleagues, who were willing to offer whatever help they could, to support other colleagues and their families. Our doctors, paramedics staff, nurses worked relentlessly to treat colleagues sometimes in real remote locations. As a result, together we were able to sail through the difficult period of the second covid wave.</p>

        <p>My second #InthisTogether moment was in the vaccination drives, where Siemens in every major location conducted a vaccination drive for all our colleagues and their families. It was a real joy to see all of us coming together, and supporting each other in these times.</p>
        <p>This was also a major collaboration event with EHS, doctors, SRE, Admins, and various businesses coming together to plan and conduct a safe and efficient vaccination drive. In Pune as well, we saw a great collaboration, from all Siemens entities in Pune planning, and organizing drives in our Balewadi campus as well as at Magarpatta office. Here again we saw our own colleagues, volunteering, across organizational boundaries, to make sure that the drives are conducted smoothly and with utmost care.</p>

        <p> For me what started as small initiatives, collaboration groups, became a benchmark on how much we can achieve if we come together and work together for a common goal. My sincere thanks to all those who made this possible. This has strengthened my belief in our spirit of collaboration and the greatness we can achieve together. </p>

        <p>Dear All,</p>
        <p>Happy to interact with you for the sixth time through our quarterly newsletter. I am glad that we have accepted that we are living in VUCA times! I have been talking about this for more than a decade now. It is not a transient state but is here to stay. This has happened not just because of geopolitical and economic reasons but also due to emerging technologies. I see this as a renaissance!</p>

        <p>Let us learn to appreciate, adapt, and apply ourselves to contribute to upsurge collectively. During these changing times, our vision has not changed. We see ourselves to be the top software house within Mobility.</p>

        <p>The overall market situation is demanding, with customers expecting more with less. Our efforts to provide cost-competitive and high-quality solutions will certainly lend support there. But what we need to develop and enhance is our competency to handle end-to-end solutions. We have understood that this is possible only if product, Development, Technology, Infrastructure, Business Excellence, HR, and BA teams work collaboratively, with each having a higher degree of competence in respective functions.</p>

        <p>I feel proud that during these times, we have not let the ball drop. In fact, as individuals and as a collective, we have demonstrated dedication, support, willingness to help and most importantly, willingness to meet challenges!</p>

        <p>Our product organization, aka LHS, has worked relentlessly to pursue opportunities with excellent support from SMO and ADVANTA management. We have been able to win some opportunities such as Delhi Metro, SILTS, and NYQBL train monitoring in the space of IEB. At the same time, we have started our engagement in additional CORE topics, for example, Simis W, WESTLOCK, UDS, SCOT tool development, Taiwan Unit testing, EOT, and DSM." This would not have been possible without proactive support from MOTO and Development teams. This is exactly what we need in an organization with a growth mindset.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>To increase our partner's confidence in us, we will have to develop bootstrap models for productivity, agility, and quality. This is only possible if we continue to invest in talent acquisition, development, and retention. The leadership team at different levels is taking multiple actions to understand and address it transparently. What we now need the most is connection, grit, and gumption! We should also continue to think and act like a startup with a large organization.</p>
        <p>I thank all of you again for your continued positive contributions, dedication & focus. Stay healthy, stay safe!</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
 
          <p>What an interesting year 2020 was! For Mobility IT, it was a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups and downs but more importantly, we kept moving forward.</p>
           
        </div>

      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>We started our journey in the middle of the lockdown last year and had our first remote joiner in the last week of June 2020.</p>

        <p>Now, as of April 2021, we are a team of more than 50 bright-minded colleagues, all onboarded fully virtually and performing excellently without meeting each other face to face even once! I believe this has never been done before within a house of Siemens and I take pride in all the accomplishments our team was able to achieve.</p>
        
        <p>Talking about accomplishments, in the last quarter, we did successful insourcing of PLM services from Atos, in time and in scope, and now our PLM team is fully delivering those services out of our IT HUB in Pune. This has resulted in better quality control over the service offerings and optimized efforts on service delivery. Our infrastructure team also successfully completed a global SharePoint migration project that resulted in improved efficiency, cost optimization, and scalability. There are many more such accomplishments and I am sure that there will be many more in the times to come.</p>
 
        <p>As part of our growth plans, we are planning on doubling our strength by the end of FY21. From a team of 50, we will become a team of 100 plus members in 7 months. This shows that we have a robust demand pipeline and support from global Siemens Mobility management to grow further. With offices remaining closed for more than a year now, all of this will need to be achieved virtually. Managing a team of more than 100+ bright minds completely virtually is a challenge as well as a new opportunity in itself.</p>

          <p>Many thanks to all those who have contributed to this journey. Looking forward to your continued support.</p>

        <p>One of the key activities that happened in the last quarter was the discussions between the COBRA Steering Committee & COBRA team. The discussion involved presentations and addresses by technical and commercial business segment leaders of Main Line (Ricardo Ramos and Nusha Heit), Mass Transit (Marc Ludwig and Ishita Aggarwal) Electrification (Markus Zachmeier and Bernd Blumenstein). The main topics covered in these meetings were a self-introduction of the segment leaders to the Cobra team, elaboration on activities for each respective segment into which the Cobra team is involved followed, segment financials followed by a Q&A session.</p>

        <p>A COBRA town hall which was held by the RI business leaders Andre Rodenbeck and Eva Scherer concluded the meeting session. After introducing themselves Andre and Eva gave an insight on the RI business perspective as well as on the rationale behind the creation of Cobra. They also shared the following slide on their expectation towards the Cobra employees:</p>

        <p>I could say that these sessions have reduced the gaps between the newly formed COBRA team in India and the leaders of various departments across the globe who has been the main pillars of COBRA. The question that was mostly asked by the participants is that “What is COBRA in your view?” and the answers given by the moderators has made us understand the real motto behind COBRA and has enhanced our way of perceiving the importance of this new group. Thanks for all the leaders for the interest they have shown in answering the queries and for their valuable time.</p>

The girl visualized aloud the exact moment of starting the performance. She described it as if in a trance, I was helping her to shape her responses ... Here she was, as steady as a rock ... breathing rhythmically.. Image of her guru in front of her eyes ... and the only overriding thought, I am going to do my best...</p>

        <p>“I am music ...” pat came the reply</p>
        <p>“A moment of excellence is born” I said.</p>
        <p>It was a very strong experience emotionally for all of us present. A rare, delightful insight into an experience called ‘excellence’ ... It was exhilarating in an enlightened manner.
        At times, the experiential truth is so strong that is difficult to catch it in words, however, if one has to consolidate the emotional insight into a blinding design of wisdom, one has to fall back on words again.</p>
        <h4>So what is excellence?</h4>
        <p>I do not think excellence has one single definition. In the future segments of this communication, I will explore different ways by which this theme can be understood. Here is the first one.</p>

        <p>Let us take for example, a popular skill amongst students such as ‘orator’s skill’. Translated in school-reality, it means participating and winning elocution and debating competitions.</p>
        
        
        <p>A student that is generally chosen by teachers for developing this skill is an expand communicative one who also has a ‘pleasant’ and ‘smart ‘disposition’.
        Suppose there is an elocution competition and five topics are given, out of which she has to select one. </p>

          <p>Controlguide Foresight (Hereafter referred to as Foresight) came into existence as a new product, independent of the current diagnostic tool (CTF-Controlguide Technician Facility) and the Control centre systems. Owned by UK R&D, Foresight will improve Siemens customer service by offering a remote diagnostic application that can be run in a portable device or a web browser to make information available to both the maintainers in the field as well as managers (or duty engineers) in offices and/or ROCs. This will help the diagnosis, the clearance of faults, and alarm management.  </p>

        <p>The application should be independent of trackside technology. In addition to fault finding and alert indications, it can also provide geolocation information of where the closest depot or access points are. An expert system will support issue resolution, giving guidance on how to solve the problem, what spares to carry, manuals and video tutorials, etc. It was also decided that to reduce the development time and costs and potential cybersecurity issues, the analytics/logic will remain in the secure safety signaling network. Simultaneously, the diagnostic data will be collected, stored, and used to provide diagnostic information to the final users using Siemens MindSphere® IoT Operating System Platform.</p>

        <p>The mentor here will ask her to think and talk about each one of the topics... what are the thoughts that come to her mind when she reads topics such as , ‘Protecting My Earth’ or ‘The Life and Times of Shivaji Maharaj’ . She is encouraged to explore each topic; in her own way. She has to just go on talking about each topic. The mentor listens keenly.</p>

        <p>“Can you now make a choice?” the mentor asks the question unconstructively. She needs to give her own explanation why she is deciding to opt for a particular topic. If she is confused, the mentor helps her to explore her confusion (please note, not to clear it).</p>

        <p>When she makes a choice she has to give justification for it. Having heard that; the mentor poses certain relevant queries regarding her choice. What is the most important aspect of the topic that she has liked? What according to her is the part of the topic that she may find difficult? If she has ‘liked’ two topics, what is one consideration that will help her to choose the one that she has chosen?</p>


        <p>At the end, the mentor and student will decide a time interval where the student has to think of all the points raised and come back with a decision.</p>

        <p>“But sir, I have already made up my mind” suppose the student says.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I appreciate ... I want you now to tell me one by one why
        and how you discarded the other topics. I am interested in knowing how you did it...”</p>

The drive for achieving bigger goals and moving ahead has been a constant human endeavor. And it does not matter what level you peg your goals; the aim is to do better than what you are doing now. There are many forces that work on us in influencing this growth, both internal  and external. And in a world that is now VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) in its nature, the external forces have multiplied, both in number and impact.</p>

The originality of expression is encouraged. A draft is now ready.</p>

        <p>The mentor and the student now discuss the style of presentation. The mentor does not impose his or any other’s style on the student. They make a list of ‘impressive orators’ that they have observed in media as well as in public life. The student makes note of the qualities that she would like to imbibe from each one of them.

        <p>While rehearsing the speech, placement of all phrases and points is discussed. The contents are rearranged, realigned and the impact is noted.

          On the day of the performance, the mentor and the student spend a short ‘exclusive time’ together.
          After the performance the mentor and the student discuss pros and cons of her own performance. Rather than saying “your delivery was too fast”, it is put as “These were the sentences where your speed was fast” Rather than saying “you need to work on your eye-to-eye contact” it is put as, “you need to periodically cover all corners of the audience by your eyes”.</p>

        <p>The student is at her best at that moment. This moment is again shared and explored by both. It is a magical moment. A touch of brilliance.

            <p>Ever wondered, how, many bogies of a Train come to a halt at the same time? The supply of pneumatic pressure from the Air generation unit to bogies at the end introduces significant delay in application of brakes. Having a Brake Control Unit in the Braking system to manage the  braking of the bogies to stop them simultaneously could be one of the answers.</p>

        <p> However, this would require revamping the existing brake system on the trains to support the Brake Control Unit – a massive logistical nightmare for any Rail Network Provider. The situation is pitiful incase of Freight trains which stretch over length of kms, requiring Railway guards to apply the brakes. This is exhaustive, unreliable and could turn fateful on Emergency Applications of brakes.</p>

        <p>Solution to this problem requires a modular control system that applies the brakes on the rear of the train with no manual intervention by constant consultation with Locomotive. EOTT End of Train Telemetry, the latest offering from Siemens is a precise fit of the Solution.</p>
 
        <p>The EOTT system mainly consists of Head of Train (HOT) fitted in locomotives and End of Train (EOT) fitted on the last vehicle of the train. EOTT has Global Positioning System (GPS) module to indicate location of the train and Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication module to transfer data to server besides the radio device for communication and control between HOT and EOT.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p> High visibility marker light flasher devices in EOT have been provided with automatic switching on and off based on the ambient light condition. The brake power pressure of the last vehicle of the train is displayed to the train driver in the HOT display in the cab of the locomotive.</p>

        <p> The driver can confirm brake power pressure drop in the train up to the last vehicle during application of air brake by observing brake power pressure of the last vehicle remotely in the HOT display. </p>

        <p> The system allows the emergency brake to be applied from the last vehicle of the train by opening a valve in EOT remotely from the cab of the locomotive. It has the provision for automatic application of train emergency air brakes also from rear when emergency train air brake is applied by loco pilot in the cab and the simultaneous application of brake from front and rear will reduce the braking distance and time for controlling the train.</p>

          <p>In case of train parting confirmed by the loco pilot, an emergency brake from EOT, if required by train driver can be applied in order to bring the rear portion to an early halt. The available provisions will boost the confidence of loco pilots during running of trains with EOTT.</p>

Japanese detectives call the crime scene genba, and Japanese TV reporters may refer to themselves as reporting from genba. In business, genba refers to the place where value is created; in manufacturing the genba is the factory floor.

This gives us an opportunity to gain more knowledge about the product, process and people. Teams have been coming up with interesting ideas to have an insightful, meaningful and fun discussion with Leadership.<p>

        <p> Through all the GEMBA walks we have been able to find our Strengths and Areas of Improvements. Our Coaches have been instrumental in order to ensure the implementation of the Action Plan along with Team Support. Let us continue to reap benefits of this Open Dialogue Platform for our continuous improvement</p>

        <h4>Umesh Barshikar – Mass Transit</h4>
        <p>Gemba walk gives a very good platform for the team to directly interact with the leadership about topics that are important to them. The ones that I was part of were very open and everyone was encouraged to speak openly without any bias. It was conducted in a very light but professional manner given enough opportunity to all the participants. Some very interesting suggestions, points came up for discussion during this initiative and it was followed up by creating a dashboard to follow up on the action items.</p>

        <h4>Vishal Gaikwad – DPS</h4>
        <p>I personally like the new format of “virtual” GEMBA walk, which was a kind of get-to-know-you and improved social connect where people could openly share their thoughts and hear views from Nikhil and Bala. The derived outcomes and actions would certainly help the DPS team to know more about the future roadmap and opportunities in MO at the same time, the leadership to know more about various happenings in the DPS space.</p>

        <p>GEMBA walk gave the entire team an opportunity to interact with Nikhil. The whole design of the meeting is to make the exercise as fun-filled as it can be, and the team thoroughly enjoyed the session. On top of our regular retrospectives, it gave us an opportunity to look at where we stand as a team. This resulted in identifying improvement areas and deriving action items, some of which helped us in overall advancement of CBTC as a team in the right direction.

            <p>A railway network is a guided system made up of controlled access and exit points. To avoid train cars from getting lost, switches guide the rail-cars along the right tracks to get them from a given access point to the exit point where their journey ends.</p>

            <p>Rail networks are under someone’s control, and they’re highly connected. These connections can be represented using different mapping methods: geographic, schematic, linear or 3D, each of which is suited to specific purposes. The geographic database plays a vital role in order to represent the railway network in the form of schematic, linear or 3D as it provides the actual physical view of various railway network topologies and its infrastructure.</p>
            <p>In PTC(Positive Train Control) project, we are working on Track Schematic module, It takes care of track layout representation wherein railway tracks are drawn horizontally across the drawing canvas on HMI, this helps a locomotive pilot to understand the current location of a train,</p>

            <p>routes ahead and around the train and constraints(speed profile and restriction). To represent every possible railway track on HMI, one must explore different routes and rail networks topologies which are present on the physical location of the railway network of railroads.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>While exploring various railway track topologies, we have come across the "OpenRailwayMap". This is a web-based tool which provides a detailed map of the world's railway infrastructure including complex railway topologies such as Teardrop where a switch branches off to a loop and merges back to the same line in the opposite direction or Crossing where one track crosses over another.</p>

        <p>OpenRailwayMap is an open source project under the GPL version 3 which is built on "OpenStreetMap". It has a detailed map of railway networks along with different overlays features. This helps to explore and understand railway routes across the world, their track topologies and associated track types. The OpenRailwayMap includes all rail-mounted and automotive vehicles, e.g., railways, subways, trams, miniature railways and funiculars. NOTE: The map does not include aerialways, monorails, and maglevs.</p>


        <p>Following are the four main overlays features based on numerous backgrounds (including hillshades):</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>for infrastructure (including milestones, switches, track numbers, signal boxes)</li>
          <li>for signals (including train protection systems)</li>
          <li>for maximum track speeds</li>
          <li>for electrification (beta)  </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Following is the example of Teardrop topologies in Savannah Yard Subdivision, owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S state of Georgia.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <h4>How can it be used in other projects?</h4>
        <p>Following are just few examples of how one can leverage the advantage of this tool:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plotting of Hi-Rail testing data on the Railway map.</li>
          <li>Detailed railroad data are an excellent basis for simulating trains and signal boxes realistically.</li>
          <li>With a detailed mapped railway infrastructure, one could develop a routing application.</li>
          <li>This map and the data are an important data source for public transport applications like timetables.</li>
          <li>One can also think of applications showing construction sites, detours, blockings,<br/> and the traffic density to represent base map for real-time traffic.</li>

          <p>Project teams require a supportive environment of process set-up, agility, system checks, safety and compliance assurance for a seamless delivery. </p>
          <p>This is where all the three teams in BE come together to enable the project delivery. Firstly, the QM team helps to set-up the base of processes for safety/non-safety based on Safety Integrity Levels, project scope, and ensures the adherence leading to good quality product. The SDS team coaches the project teams to add value delivery through discovery of best practices during execution with built-in quality and faster delivery. Finally, the RAMS team helps in validating the safety requirements right from definition of requirements to understanding how the product meets the agreed safety norms at the end of lifecycle.</p>

              <p><strong>Not so long ago – Aug 2020:</strong> </p>

              <p>Imagine that you are an athlete who starts the race in the 5KMs category but ends up running a full marathon. That is the MO CMMI journey in a nutshell. </p>

              <p>CMMI implementation and assessment started off as a simple gap-finding exercise leadership an ambitious program of achieving CMMI Level 3 that too on a relatively new version (CMMI V2.0).  </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Our projects stand on solid foundations of GUIDE and/or IMS Quality Management Systems(QMS).</p>
              <p>This gave leadership good confidence to embark on this ambitious project. The journey started on 25th September 2020</p>

There were business needs and priorities that eventually led us to embark on this journey on 25th September 2020.</p> -->
          <h4>Pre Race Preparation:</h4> 
          <p>First, a gap assessment of the Guide process as well as MCR & CTF projects was performed by the QAI assessor. MO & SE segments were chosen to undergo the assessment. The final assessment was scheduled to be in April 2021, barely 6 months from the kickstart.</p>
          <p>A plan of action was chalked out, shared, and refined with the G0T0(MO Pune Leadership) team. Based on CMMI gap assessment findings, project size & ownership, 7 projects - CTF, MCR, GUIDO, MDA, ESBO AGenDA, ITS connectivity and, ITS DCS  were shortlisted. The plan of action was discussed with all relevant stakeholders.</p>
          <p>
            Along with projects, Quality function and leadership were also in the scope of assessment.
          </p>
          <h4>The Race Begins:</h4> 
          <p>All the participants involved started tracking towards the planned milestones. By December, projects had to demonstrate the readiness of CMMI practices. The quality team conducted an internal audit to validate the readiness in January. The March milestone was to show the readiness for one project to QAI Lead Appraiser.</p>
          <p>All these milestones were to be completed while maintaining existing delivery commitments and other BAU activities.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <h4>Challenges on course:</h4>

          <p>In addition to the short timelines, Covid was still lurking around. Covid infections and sickness hit the team. The decision to recruit two more Quality Managers turned out to be a great mitigation strategy and helped the team overcome some of the covid related shortage of staff.</p>

          <h4>Final Lap: </h4>
          <p>Out of the nominated projects, CMMI institute randomly selected 3 projects (ESBO AGenDA, GUIDO, MDA) for the assessment. So the spotlight was now turned on these 3 projects. As preparation, we had multiple mock interviews, gap closure verification, Process Implementation Indicator Document (PIID) updates with Project team members, PMs, QMs, ATMs, Central quality team members.</p>
          <p>During the final assessment - ESBO AGenDA, GUIDO & MDA projects demonstrated strong process implementation for the required practice areas, QM team and Leadership underwent assessment. </p>
          <p>Our ATMs also worked round the clock, checking every piece of evidence and conducting in-depth interviews to verify the strength of our process implementation. </p>
          <p>We finally aced the assessment and ADV MO & SE segments were recommended for CMMI V2.0 level 3 by QAI & CMMI. </p>
          <p>Overall, it was a great learning experience for everyone involved in this journey and a stellar performance by all.</p>

          <h4>About CMMI:</h4>
          <p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is an integrated set of best practices that enable businesses to improve performance of their key business processes. CMMI provides a clear roadmap for building, improving, and sustaining capability. Best practices in the model focus on What needs to be done to improve performance, not How to do it. Trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas.</p>
          <p>CMMI 2.0 model was developed by product teams with members from industry and CMMI Institute. CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing. To reach the next higher level of Maturity one must comply with all the previous levels.</p>

            <p>MOTO Garage is an effort from Pune Mobility Technology Office to provide an avenue for people who want to learn something different than what they get to work on their regular projects. This is a voluntary initiative whereby people can learn and contribute to small innovations. It gives opportunities for individuals to work on technologies of their choice, and play roles of their choice. E.g. One could be working as a Tech Lead on a product that is based on C++. In MOTO Garage the same person can be an architect for a Java project or a Product Owner on an AI project.</p>

          <p>MOTO launched an initiative called MOTO Labs to address this challenge. MOTO Labs are once a month hands on sessions. Every Labs instance addresses one such topic every month. The sessions are driven by people who have extensively used the tool or technique or library in real projects. The focus is on getting participants from being complete novices in the topic to having a functional setup, writing & executing some sample programs , providing inputs on how to avoid pitfalls that beginners face & sharing resources for further learning.</p>

              <p>We have seen that having a Traffic signal is the fastest and most economical method to control traffic at a single or simple intersection. Which are typically operating in the "Fixed time plan" i.e. if there is 4 leg intersection we typically allocate 30 -40 sec Green time depending on the traffic load of each leg. </p>

          <p>This type of operation will not be sustainable for a longer time. After a 3 to 5 years span as traffic increases the effectiveness of such a “Fix time signal plan” system gets deteriorated.</p>
          <p>Then we have also seen that with the help of a "Traffic detector," we started to detect traffic with a little bit more details like Vehicle Type / Count / Speed, etc. This gives a push to dynamically adjust traffic signal plans as per traffic behavior which we called ATMS "Adaptive Traffic Management System". This system is still limited to one junction only.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Here we are not considering the traffic situation at the adjacent junction or nearby area so travelers may get consecutive “RED” signals while passing such a corridor or area which may lead to traffic jams though we have signals and traffic detectors are in place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Here coordination between two or more junctions in a particular area or corridor is a key issue. This issue can be solved using the new generation's latest software and communication technology.</p>

          <p>Assume that every intersection is connected to a central server and shares detectors/traffic flow data. Server applications are very intelligent and take collaborative decisions which leads to ease of traffic. This evolution gives us better control over one "Area" instead of one intersection, this technology/ method is called ATCS "Area Traffic Control System".</p>

                <p>Some special types of detectors are also used to identify the type of vehicle i.e if Vehicle is a public transport/emergency vehicle then ATCS can give priority to these vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Product Organization at Advanta Mobility aims at building such expertise. One great way of building such expertise is by learning from people who have been there and done that.</p> 
          <p>Siemens Mobility has many key experts who drive a variety of topics from technology, domain, engineering and product development standpoint. They have deep expertise and experience in the topics they are working with.</p> 
          <p>For the Advanta Mobility team it is important to gain expertise in the topics that we work on. It is important to understand the journey taken by these experts within the SMO organization and learn from it.</p> 
          <p>Know your Key Expert is such an attempt to understand their journey by setting up fireside chat sessions with as many experts that we can reach out to.  The fireside chat will encourage these experts to share their personal and professional journey.</p> 
          <p>Very first of such sessions was arranged in the month of July 2021 with Dr. Thomas Gehrke. Dr Gehrke  is a Principal Key Expert for Digitalization, Diagnostics and Maintenance concepts. He shared that experiential learning has helped him to lead various important topics in this area. Our team found this session very insightful and inspiring.</p> 
          <p>We hope that connecting ADV D MO team with these experts will inspire few of us to become experts in topics that we handle. </p>

At COBRA Management we have mitigated well for these challenges and had enough options to turn around things for us. </p>
              <p>Collaboration and team spirit were to be improved as some of the important aspects that we missed are get together, physical interactions, fun parties, etc., which play key roles to understand each other within the organization.</p>

          <p>Our Growth is rapid and at the same time demanding to adapt methods to bring people together. As an organization unit, we have the unique opportunity which no one ever had and will ever have in the future in the rail business. From the day of inception till today every deal and engagement is going on virtually, picture perfect. Whenever an opportunity arises we do not hesitate to accept, we wholeheartedly thank our colleagues who standby us and are constantly delivering.</p>
          <p> Technology has provided enough options to stay connected. We have initiated a few drives to bring people together virtually. One such occasion was “Come together - Intra Group discussion” which kicked in during recent weeks. This was an exciting program and a platform which brings out the hidden facades of the people. We realized that collaboration and Spirit of team work can happen beyond the four walls.</p>
          <p>Intra Group meet has been planned for 11 Teams of COBRA over the span of 12 weeks. Below is the list of various groups:</p>

            <li>Product Solution & Safety</li>
          </ul> -->
          <p>During the intra- group collaboration, colleagues from every group focused more on the structure and responsibilities of the presenting group. The intra-group environment on the other hand, led them to discuss the function of their models, ask for and provide reasonings for the functions. We discuss the various tasks carried out by the specific group and cultivate ideas for integration of the inter and intra group tools.</p>
          <p>The benefits of collaboration are well researched, which allows organizations to encourage employees talents to coordinate knowledge, and allow information to reach to the place well in time where it is needed, to take prompt actions. By taking the right actions at the right time the organization will be benefited.</p>
          <p>In COBRA we work on different type of work packages viz, module specific, sharing different scopes of projects with stakeholders and responsible for inland projects. This kind of platform will allow people to come together and know each other better so that their collaboration improves to support the project effectively and subsequently, we will have happy customers.</p>

              <p>As we all know by now, COVID affects everyone in a different manner. Mrinmoy for example, initially suffered from just mild symptoms but soon realised he had COVID when he lost his sense of taste and smell. As he was the only person in his family to have contracted COVID, he spent around two weeks in self-isolation. While away from his family, he used technology like video calls and youtube to stay connected with his loved ones.</p> 

              <p>One key takeaway from his experience that he shared during the #MyCoWinStory Podcast was about the importance of staying positive and keeping all the negative thoughts at bay. We are sure that his story of overcoming COVID and even more so the isolation has helped so many of the listeners.</p> 

              <p>Similarly, the strength and resilience shown by Mohnish during the first wave when everyone in his family, including him, got COVID showed us how to overcome critical situations. Through his experience shared on the podcast, we understood the importance of consulting a doctor in a timely manner and taking the right decisions quickly. </p>

              <p>The goal of #MyCoWinStory Podcast was to provide an insight into the unfamiliar and unpredictable territory that is COVID while spreading a positive message through the resilience of SIEMENS employees.</p>

              <p> Furthermore, there are increasing government regulations (e.g. NIST Cyber security framework, KRITIS, NIS, HITECH Act, FDA Guidance on Cyber security) as well as strong customer demands for increased security (e.g. IEC62443 and ISO/IEC27001 certification).</p>
              
              <p>The PSS topic is of great importance and is one that needs both concrete actions in the various functions (e.g. product management, R&D, project management, service) but also it must be addressed holistically with an “end-to-end” view in order to achieve our goal to provide security in the products, solutions, and services for our customers. Security cannot be an afterthought - we have to address security early and often in all relevant development and engineering activities.</p>

          <p>The PSS team created a robust plan to focus on Construction and Verification function areas to reach the interim maturity level 1 in a year's time by end of Sep 20. Team worked on all related security practices and could reach set goal before the target date.</p>
          <p>For hitting the set target level 2, PSS team focused on ‘Process and Compliance’, ‘Security requirements’ and ‘Secured architecture’ practices in the current financial year 2021.</p>
          <p> Our next assessment is planned at the end of the financial year, and we are on track to hit level 2 in all targeted 3 business functions. Next financial year will focus on the last ‘Deployment’ business function to reach maturity of Level 2 in all business functions. Thank you everyone for your support to make it possible!

          <p> Our next assessment is planned at the end of the financial year, and we are on track to hit level 2 in all targeted 3 business functions. Next financial year will focus on the last ‘Deployment’ business function to reach maturity of Level 2 in all business functions. Thank you everyone for your support to make it possible! Special thanks to Nikhil, Maxraj, Iqbal and Anil for this wonderful maturity Journey!!</p>

          <p>Communication networks play a very critical role here, this network might be GPRS / Fiber connectivity to a centralized ATCS center.  As shown in the figure this communication network is responsible for collecting all detector data Via the Traffic signal controller and sending it to the ATCS center and getting processed data/decision data that is updated signal plans and given to the Signal controller.</p>

          <p>With an eye on some operational challenges and future improvements, SMO Management has planned to standup a mechanical CAD (MCAD) support team at Pune centre. COVID-19 situation and Lockdowns forced us to rethink this plan. Still, management has decided to go for a completely Virtual Onboarding and successfully onboarded 12 Team members for PDMLink and Conversion team in Pune centre within 4 to 6 months.</p>

          <p>While we never imagined onboarding to a new job virtually, we are happy to report that things are going just smooth in the new normal. </p>

      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>As we were located in different parts of India and our team is thousands of miles away from us in Europe, we felt much pressure - sometimes worrying if we made the right decision or not, by changing jobs when the whole world is in COVID-19 and the financial crisis. </p>
        <p>SMO Management and HR team helped to relieve some of this pressure by their caring approach towards new employees from the very first week. Virtual sessions like All Hand meetings, Buddy Talks, talks with CIO, Daily standups, Weekly team meetings, Jour Fixes, and German coaching helped build positive momentum in all teams to work together. </p>
        <p>We were also provided a one-time amount to set up home office furniture and IT accessories. Yoga and workout sessions were planned considering employee health and comfort.</p>
        <p> Good planning for knowledge sharing sessions and keeping breathing space between the sessions to digest the knowledge was essential. Also, there was enough overlap in Passive and Active shadowing with the ATOS Team to completely and successfully take over the ownership of the SMO MCAD support services starting from 1st January 2021.</p>
        <p>Insourcing will help us to take more ownership, raise flexibility, improve collaboration, lower overall cost and support our Business Units in a better way. Plans for the future are currently a major PLM system upgrade and the implementation of Teamcenter as our new PLM platform. Thank you to every member of SMO to make this Journey successful </p>

         2020 has been that year which taught us the importance of the above quote. It has completely changed the way most of us work. Our relationships with our colleagues have been redefined. Going for lunch together, having a cup of tea at the local tapri, celebrating birthdays – usually, these were the moments that helped us grow from a group of individuals to a team. Covid-19 has prevented us from enjoying such real-life moments, and it seems it might continue to do so for a while. However, this does not mean that we stop growing and connecting.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>The initial days of work from home were a huge adjustment, but we all learned to adapt ourselves. As part of this journey, we moved our day-to-day practices from the real world to this virtual world. Being part of a team meant a lot of things. A day in the office for our team generally started with the daily scrum meeting. Our first order of business was to conduct this online. Tracking this in such a way that the status is visible to all the stakeholders was very important.</p>
        <p>We now have a daily 15-minute standup facilitated by our Scrum Master, wherein each team member gives an update of the task they are working on using the RTC dashboard. In the absence of the scrum master, any team member steps up to conduct the same. This is true for all the agile ceremonies such as the Sprint review, Sprint retrospective and backlog grooming. </p>

        <p>It has been a continuous learning process to time box ourselves. However, we feel that the daily standup is essential for us as this is a required human connection we need to kick start our day.</p>
        <p>During the past year, we also had a successful release. This would not have been possible without the entire team's joint effort. In the beginning, it was a bit overwhelming to figure out how to work together virtually. We had a bit of a shaky start, but finally, we set ourselves a new rhythm.</p>

        <p>We learnt to break the tasks down into smaller stories to achieve better sprint velocity, spend more time in understanding the requirements together so that we could work on them individually, squinted away at the fine print-</p>

        <p>  of a screen shared during a call to discuss and debug solutions all the while keeping the goal of the release in mind. Siemens also ensured that we could grow individually by giving us access to different pieces of training and certifications. Team members have completed various activities such as IMS, AI/ML, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Being at home unable to interact with others does take its toll, though. Different people went through different emotional upheavals. However, we have always tried to maintain an open communication line, be it among ourselves or with our managers. We had talks wherein each team member openly spoke about the difficulties and challenges they were facing, and we tried figuring out how we could make things better for them. Every day we have a DND ( Do not disturb) time zone wherein we keep aside an hour roughly. It is the me-time for each individual wherein he/she is free to do whatever they want. It could be completing some housework, resting for some time or even just completing an individual task without having anyone disturb them at that time. </p>

        <p>As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". It was essential during these trying times to maintain the team spirit. We started with a Fun Friday every sprint where the entire team gets together and plays games. Before Covid-19, we would never have imagined that we would have had so much fun playing games such as Dumb Charades, Treasure Hunt, Fun Quizzes, Pictionary, Antakshari, Bingo! so many more virtually. Everyone participates wholeheartedly, and there is a competitive spirit like when we were kids! It's been a challenge to figure out something new each time, but the fun, happiness, stress release and bonding that takes place is a delight.</p>
        <p>We have had at least three new members join the team during this time, and we found that having such events was the best way to make them feel comfortable and welcome them into the team. </p>

        <p>No matter how big or small, we should celebrate and appreciate occasions and people. Appreciation cards have been doing the rounds for the excellent work an individual or the team has put in. At the same time, we have had many other reasons to celebrate, be it birthdays, marriages, anniversaries or births, we have been blessed. Not being able to celebrate in the office together did not stop us, however. Every birthday is celebrated with a small video filled with wishes and funny moments. We get together on call and sing Happy Birthday ( though we still haven't learnt how to sing together 😉 ) and pull each other's legs.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Even though we are cities apart, we still feel the team spirit which is very apparent during our celebrations and fun sessions. It's been a huge learning curve to learn to live in this new normal, but the journey together as a team has made it worth it. </p>

          <p>Traffic congestion is becoming a critical issue day by day. This is due to the increased urbanization, industrialization, and vehicle density. Sometimes emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks are stuck in traffic and unable to reach in time for rescue.  </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>The worst traffic jams or long queues occur at intersections where cars, bikes, buses, or pedestrians cross the road. If we can manage traffic at such intersections, we might resolve this issue significantly. Almost all big cities have traffic signals and a dedicated traffic police force for managing everyday traffic. In case of emergencies, the police can use a traffic control panel to make dynamic signal changes or take control over intersection traffic manually.</p>
        
        <p>
          "Vehicle-Actuated Signals" is one of the preferred methods for optimizing intersection traffic. There are also various detectors used for actuation. e.g., inductive loop detectors, radar, RFID, or cameras. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-center" src="newTheme/img/traffic.jpg" alt="">
          <span class="img-caption">Vehicle-Actuated Signals</span>  
        </p>
        <p>Signal controller programs take these detector actuations as input from all approach lanes and dynamically adjust the signal timing plan and reduce queue length on all lanes as much as possible.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>These steps help reduce congestion time significantly. Some cities have preferred special vehicle detection mechanisms to detect emergency vehicles and public transport vehicles to prioritize cross intersections.  </p> 

        <p>Typically, traffic signal controllers operate in three modes.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-Timed Signal:</strong> In this mode, a traffic signal's Green-Amber-Red timing is fixed, and these patterns are repeated throughout the day. Sometimes, these fixed timing partners or designs are based on historical traffic scenarios. An example can be giving more time to the green signals in the morning, especially those that lead to offices or industrial areas. This will ensure the smooth movement of traffic.</p>

        <p><strong>Actuated Signal:</strong>  In this method, one can use vehicle detectors to detect traffic based on queue length, vehicle type, and priority; based on these factors, signal controllers can optimize signal timing dynamically. Taking the same scenario as above, if there is more traffic moving towards the office or industrial area, a lane could get maximum green time dynamically.</p>

          <p><strong>Mixed-Mode:</strong>   One can use this mode at major and minor traffic road junctions. Typically, major roads have fixed timing, and minor roads get actuated signals. By doing this, minor roads will get a green signal when there is sizable traffic. Otherwise, you end up prioritizing just major-road traffic.</p>

          <ul style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem">
            <li>They can reduce congestion/delay (if properly timed).</li>

          Disadvantages of Actuated Signals
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If the traffic demand pattern is very regular, the extra benefit of adding local actuation is minimal or non-existent.</li>
          <li>Installation cost is two to three times the cost of a pre-timed signal installation.</li>
          <li>Actuated controllers are much more complicated than pre-timed controllers, increasing maintenance costs.</li>
          <li>They require careful inspection & maintenance to ensure proper operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Traffic engineers are coming up with newer concepts like Signal Synchronization, which allows coordinating traffic signals along a single route so that vehicles get a progressive green signal at each junction. This is another crucial aspect that we will discuss more in the upcoming newsletter.  </p>

            I started my journey in Ansible playbook automation with the idea of moving away from traditional script automation tools and deployment models on virtual machines to something more simple, sequential, agent-less, and powerful in terms of configuration management and workflow orchestration required in a Cloud environment. And Ansible was the answer.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Below is the step by step guide on how to get started with playbook creation, execution, and troubleshooting in Ansible:</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Creating a Playbook — Know-How:</h3>

        <p>I began my first playbook creation by converting the existing Network Shell script for product installation on a virtual machine in a Cloud environment to a playbook. Playbooks are expressed in YAML format and mostly consist of a series of sequential ‘tasks’. At a very basic level, a task is nothing more than a call to an Ansible module, which is a predefined set of system commands, resources, etc.
        To have an overview of playbook creation, here is the official link to the documentation: AnsiblePlaybooks</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Steps to execute playbook:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li> The first step in executing a playbook is to check for any syntax errors while writing the playbook <br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml -- syntax-check/</pre></li>
          <li> Below is the step to execute a playbook <br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml</pre></li>
          <li> For detailed debugging step by step for a playbook use this command:<br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml -- step -vv</pre></li>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
       <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Troubleshooting a playbook:</h3>

        <p>The most common errors faced while executing a playbook are:</p>
        
        <p><strong>1. No such file or directory</strong></p>
        
        <p>— Usually, for this kind of error, you need to look if the file is executable by checking the permissions of the file.</p>
        <p>— Another thing to check is if you are running the playbook as a root user or any other non-root Ansible user which has the required privileges to execute the playbook.</p>
        <p>— Another basic error could be that the file is not copied properly to the target server before execution</p>

        <p><strong>2. Permissions denied</strong></p>
        <p>— You may need to check if the user ID you’re using to execute the playbook on the server has the correct permissions to execute the playbook or if you need to root otherwise.</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Best practices to be followed:</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li> Copy the required sh script, tar, zip files, and whatever else is required for installation of any of the software/products on the virtual machines for which we are writing the Ansible playbook in the proper folder structure in your GIT repository.</li>
        </ul>

          <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">

            <li> It is a best practice to provide the name of all the tasks which are performed in the playbook to increase the readability for another user.</li>

            <li> Always mention the target hosts in your playbook at the top before beginning the actual playbook. Please make sure to also add the same in /etc/ansible.cfg file on the main server.</li>

            <li> If you’re stuck with any command while developing a playbook, use the official guide at docs.ansible.com to look for the command, along with its syntax and various parameters. For e.g. for executing a shell script via an Ansible playbook, we have two modules available in Ansible: Shell module and Script module.</li>
          </ul>
           <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg" style="margin-bottom: 8px">Troubleshooting a playbook:</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Pro Tip: Using the -step -vv ( verbose) while executing your playbook can help playbook developers troubleshoot and optimize their scripts interactively and — when things go wrong — provide valuable triage information.</strong></p>

          <p>Automation frees admins up to focus on efforts that help deliver more value to the business by speeding time to application delivery and building on a culture of success.</p>

        <p>The last year or so has seen all of us evolve. We have learnt to work, collaborate, survive & flourish in ways different from the ways we followed earlier. This evolution has been challenging, often making us throw many of the long held assumptions out of the window. The R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program has been no exception to this.</p>

        <p>We launched the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program a couple of years back in order to help us be ready for many of the industry 4.0 challenges & also to help us be better prepared for the growth that we were foreseeing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p> Over the last 24 months, especially the year 2020, we have seen the need to decentralize, go virtual & distributed to answer the needs of these challenging times. R<small>N</small>D NG(Next Generation) is the next evolution of the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program in this direction. However, before we talk about what has changed, let's quickly look back at 2020 from R<small>N</small>D 4.0 perspective.</p>
        
        <img src="newTheme/img/rnd-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-colored">
 
        <p>We evolved the program to suit the virtual world. Some of the initiatives had to be discontinued, some evolved & some new ones got added. We continued to get together to listen to technical presentations every alternate week in Tech Break Sessions. Having crossed a half century of the sessions, we took a short break from Tech Break & have returned in the new year with a new set of topics. ToastMasters club has now more than 75 sessions under its belt. It continues on a fortnightly basis. CI/CD initiative saw significant improvement in CI/CD maturity of the 10 targeted projects. The initiative is now being owned by DevOPS team.</p>
         
        <p>We did a very interesting domain express session on Tunnel Management. We have also found the limitations of the virtual world to do events like domain express. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>That has not stopped us from exchanging bits of knowledge oriented topics. Through ITS Quiz, Domain Quiz, Testing Bytes & Did You Know we have tried to bring around interesting bits of information & trivia to you. We launched domain dictionary to make it easy for you to get detailed understanding & information about various domain related topics.</p>

        <p>You continue to express your appreciation for all your colleagues through appreciation cards which saw a redesign this year. We have piloted a new innovation management process that is based on Shout Out Circles.</p>

        <p> Getting feedback from people is important to keep making things better. Various mechanisms like virtual Gemba walk, Project Reflections, and Retro Appetizers were used to collect the feedback which could be used for decision making at various levels. We have worked on streamlining the procurement process for hardware items to make life better for requesters as well as approvers.</p>

        <p>This newsletter, which is published every quarter, is also one of the initiatives within the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program. Now we have participation from all 3 Mobility groups based out of Pune. The newsletter is shared & appreciated globally.</p>
 
        <p>As we are taking this journey, we have also realized the need to distribute and align better. With that in mind we are reshaping the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program into R<small>N</small>D NG program. While the core values and way of working remains the same, the R<small>N</small>D NG program will have more participation from the G0T0 team. At least 2 G0T0 members have become champions for each of the levers.</p>

          Magnification in train control system
        </h3>
        <div class="info__main-content">
          <p>Metro Signalling & Train control system technology focus means of reducing headway, ensuring safety, and improving efficiency and reduction in the cost of operation. The Signalling & Train Control system on Main Line Railways and Metros are different on account of very different traffic requirements besides civil and E&M infrastructure. Signalling & Train Control in metros not only ensures train safety, but it also integrates, interfaces, and automates areas of operation, driving, passenger information, collection of information, and analysis of the same. Signalling & Train Control systems have been dominated using Track Circuit-based Signalling & Train Control for more than five decades.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        
        <p>The success of Metro rail systems lies in their ability to provide frequent, fast, safe, and comfortable journeys in the urban conglomeration, not only to the regular commuters but also to the occasional traveler or tourist alike. Signalling and Train Control systems play a major role in achieving these objectives. While enhancing operational efficiency by providing control systems to achieve the target headway, it also always ensures the total safety of the train movements besides adding value to other systems by the on-line interface.</p>
        <p>The rapid developments in the computer and microcircuit technology, as well as telecommunication, have led to the development of Integrated Metro Control systems, in which computers (including failsafe forms of computers) fulfill many of the decision making roles traditionally performed by Train operators, station controllers, Traffic controllers, etc., eventually leading to the introduction of highly automated Metro Rail with driverless trains.</p>
        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Need for Train detection and methods used: </h3>
        <p>To convey information to a train about where to stop and at what speed to run required all the trains on any line to be detected automatically by the system. This was achieved by the invention of the so-called “Track circuits”. Track circuits were first invented in the USA (DC Track circuits) in 1872 and later picked up and improved by British railways. London Underground was the first large-scale user in a Metro rail network 1904-06.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
         <p>The need to provide information to train resulted in the invention of “Coded Track circuits” with modulation of a basic AC carrier with codes. These required insulated joints between sections of rails like earlier track circuits for demarcating the individual track circuit blocks. Later came the “Jointless Track circuits” which use audio frequencies and provide high impedance between adjacent track circuits by a tuning process thus avoiding the need for insulated joints. These are commonly called Audio frequency Track Circuits (AFTC) and these help in transmitting codes that modulate the basic AFTC carrier which in turn are picked up by an antenna suspended below the train. </p>
        <p>In addition to track circuits, another system called “Axle counter” is also used for train detection. In this method, axles are detected through a magnetic circuit linking a transmitter and a receiver across the rail, and whenever a metallic axle interposes the received signal drops are detected and counted as one pulse. In this manner, all the axles coming into one block are counted at the entry and if all the axles are counted out at the exit of the block the block is declared as clear.  </p>
        <p>In the latest advancement in Metro signalling, a system called Communication based train control (CBTC) has been in use for more than a decade. In this system, the primary train detection is purely based on a failsafe communication link between the train and the control center with the train communicating its position continuously and the control Centre communicates the position to other trains for maintaining the safety distance between two trains. Track circuits or axle counters if any are used only as a secondary detection in case the Metro operator desires a fallback system.</p>

            Characteristics of Communication-Based Train Control System (CBTC)
          </h3>
          <p>Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a railway signalling system that makes use of the telecommunications between the train and track equipment for traffic management and train control. CBTC systems enable, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signalling systems, which results more efficiently and safely to manage the railway traffic and improve headway.</p>
          <p>CBTC systems allow different levels of automation or Grades of Automation, GoA, as classified in the IEC 62290-1. CBTC is not a synonym for “driverless” or “automated trains” although it is considered as a basic technology for this purpose.</p>
          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">
            Driverless Train Operation (DTO) and Unattended Train Operation (UTO): 
          </h3>            
          <p>More sophisticated systems free the driver from the need to be at the front of the train – referred to as Driverless Train Operation (DTO) or GOA level 3. In DTO the driver can move away from the front of the train but remains available to provide customer-facing duties and to drive the train in the event of a failure of the DTO/ATO system. </p>
          <p>As the driver is no longer able to see the route ahead this imposes a greater demand on guideway security and platform controls. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Platform screen doors must be provided, to allow ATO to handle door closing also on the signal from ATP that all the Platform Screen Doors have closed fully. </p>
        
        <p>In DTO, train doors and train departure from a station platform may also be controlled automatically or manually from a location other than a driver cab at the front of the train. ATO can be given the operating instructions by the ATS regarding dwell time and hold for regulating the train on platforms as required by the operational situation and in the normal course, the driver wherever he happens to be on the train is relieved of all operational workload. </p>

        <p>CCTV information of the inside of coaches is transmitted live in new systems to OCC for controllers to observe for any untoward incidents inside the moving train and with other advancements in prevention and detection of unauthorized access to the viaduct or tunnel, even a separate train operator is no longer required on the cab in the train. The space required for the equipment could also be saved and passenger capacity increased at the end cabs. Thus, it became possible to have an Unattended Train Operation. Driverless ATO without an on-board attendant is referred to as Unattended Train Operation (UTO) or GOA level 4. UTO can range from empty train movements ( only to a siding, or in an automated depot, for example) to the operation of trains in passenger service with no attendant on board. The latter requires that the reliability of the systems has to be of a higher level and the train can be operated remotely under failure conditions, or at the minimum can be reached by shore-based personal in a short period.</p>


      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p> Passengers need to be reassured and hence good communication and CCTV links between the vehicle and an informed staff member at OCC or a specified location are essential.</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Benefits of CBTC</h3> 

        <h4>CBTC makes effective use of infrastructure in the following ways</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Allows trains at closer headways. </li>
          <li>Greater precision and control of trains is possible. </li>
          <li>Provides continuous safe train separation & over-speed protection. </li>
          <li>Utilizes the track most efficiently while ensuring safety. </li>
        </ul> 
        <h4>CBTC requires less maintenance cost due to:</h4> 
        <ul>
          <li>Driverless system (or upgradable to driverless) to reduce operating costs. </li>

            Risks of CBTC
          </h3>
          <p>The primary risk of a CBTC system is that if the communications link between any of the trains is disrupted then all or part of the system might have to enter a failsafe state until the problem is remedied. Depending on the severity of the communication loss, this state can range from vehicles temporarily reducing speed, coming to a halt, or operating in a degraded mode until communications are re-established.</p>
          <p>Communications failures can result from equipment malfunction, electromagnetic interference, weak signal strength or saturation of the communications medium. In this case, an interruption can result in a service brake or emergency brake application as real-time situational awareness is a critical safety requirement for CBTC and if these interruptions are frequent enough it could seriously impact service.</p>
          <p>Cyber-physical challenge is the severe risk in this system. CBTC Systems that make use of open standards for wireless digital communications link have a much larger attack surface and can be subject to various types of hacking including intrusion of the communications network and tampering with safety-critical messages that, in the worst case, could result in a safety hazard.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        
        <p>CBTC systems may be designed with centralized supervision systems, to improve maintainability and reduce installation costs. If so, there is an increased risk of a single point of failure that could disrupt service over an entire system or line.</p>

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>
          <p>I am K. Sakthisubramanian, joined as the Head of Engineering in the COBRA team. Being a part of the COBRA team where growth and development are the main goals, how it would be correct if GROWTH is not been voiced by me. So, I would like to share some thoughts and concepts of GROWTH in this article for everybody’s knowledge sake.</p>

      <p>The growth of an organization is not possible without having a strong goal, leadership with a vision and an enthusiastic team even if the funds are available.  Hence, when we talk about the growth of an organization it has the growth of the individuals in it which leads us to get a strong team with a leader. </p> 
      <p>Every time when I hear about “GROWTH”, the first thing which relates to me is the MINDSET.  The growth MINDSET which is a must need for the GROWTH of organization, individual career etc., </p>  
      <p>The Growth Mindset basically is about the way how every situation can be improved better through the previous experiences, lessons learnt and practices.  With a growth mindset, the failure is not considered as a detriment rather considered as a step closer to the success.   </p>
      <p>With the Growth mindset the organization and the individuals in the organization should start cultivating a strong culture of learning from every situation as the growth is a natural consequence of learning.  Regular discussions on the performances of the individuals need to be performed by the managers.  Leaders need to focus mainly on valuing the employee’s contributions, suggestions, and feedback in order to route to the success. There should be opportunities provided for the talent improvements of the individuals and time for generating innovative ideas in order to reach the success. Following the growth mindset is a “change in progress” in order to reach every new goal of the organization.</p>


      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Having a growth mindset and willing to take new opportunities / risks to excel in your career are the main requirements for the success of every individual.  Putting the best efforts in line to reach the targets will take you to success.  The individual success will always move into the path of career growth.</p>
        <p>Let me tell a short story of my life which led to success.</p>
        <p>“I started my career as a trainee in 2004 at a HitachiRail company (earlier it was known as USS) in Bangalore, after a couple of months theoretical training on Railway Signaling  which includes 2 weeks of training in the Indian railway institute (IRISET).</p>
        <p> I was assigned as a site engineer in Allahabad, UP.  Having a little knowledge on signaling and products also being a born and brought up from a small town in Tamil nadu (a state from down south of India and my hometown is near to Kanyakumari the south end of India) first time I have to move to a different state which is around 2311KMs from my native where we don’t have an office and I don’t know anyone.  I am the only kid for my parents and need to leave them alone in which case my dad is a heart patient who had just got a cardiac arrest a couple of months ago.  </p>

          <p> Taking this challenge as an opportunity to learn the systems and develop my career I went to Allahabad, learned the HitachiRail system in detail facing all the criticalities in the field and was working there for a year.  Considering that after a year of my learning I will get an opportunity to move back myself to the design office in Bangalore (which is comparatively close to my native) however, I got another challenge as I got transferred to Firozpur, Punjab(near to the Pakistan Border)as a site manager(in-charge) based on my good performances in Allahabad. However, this was a challenge for me in my personal life as I have to further travel 1100 kms towards the north but considering it as an opportunity to prove myself further in a next level as a site in charge I went to Punjab and succeeded in that assignment as well.<p>
          <p>  Based on my performances and capabilities of independently handling the local contractors, customers and managing the site activities which includes the verification of the design during testing and commissioning, I got the opportunity to work on the biggest project KFW (in 2006).  Once I entered the KFW project I concentrated on design and proved myself on the design capabilities by placing myself in Noida office for around 6 years sacrificing my expectations to work in Bangalore.  My goal and my growth mindset doesn’t get stopped, it continued and made me come across all the hurdles before me and placed me in a lot of positions from Design engineer, Team leader, Work Package Leader,  Design Manager, etc., and officially to reach as the Head of Metro Application India in 2019 in HitachRail.</p>

        <p>Every individual team member is informed to consider the growth mindset as an important tool to get yourselves to your targets.  Nobody can stop you when you are ready to move towards your GROWTH with a growth mindset.  </p>

          <p>The term RAMS, apart from meaning Random Access Memory, also stands for Reliability Availability Maintainability and Safety, of which I am a member. The newborn team in Siemens Mobility is an active bunch of validators and safety engineers. We specialize in validation- and safety-related activities. This means we stamp the products that are fit and safe to use for railway applications. We are also invaluable when it comes to Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) and Customer Acceptance Assessments.</p>
          
          <p>While our early RAMS activities are confined to projects in the UK, our validation activities have been picked for projects in Germany and Spain. </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>RAMS has grown phenomenally during the course of a year, from a one-member team to nine members today. This is all thanks to the continuous efforts and successful deliveries of assigned projects. The team always strives to find the balance between the project constraints and RAMS aspects which is no easy task to achieve. Our team drives on 3Cs - Competency, Collaboration, and Communication.  The competency aspect of the team is not only taken care of with keen and considerate criteria for eligibility but also periodic nurturing within the team through Knowledge Sharing Sessions (KSS). </p>

       <p>These sessions contain learnings from specific projects, discussion of concepts, and introduction of techniques. Collaboration is done by offering training to fellow teams on EN standards, RAMS topics, and validation aspects. At Advanta level, the collaboration is reflected in our support for their safety-related queries as most teams find it hard to find the safety relatedness of their project’s or product’s functionality. Communication plays a key role in our work profile. It’s the medium for successful and smooth competency development and collaboration. </p>

            "Skill" & "Competency" are buzzwords in all the talent centric industries across the world, including Mobility. While importance attached to it is understood, there are limited avenues to holistically understand it as is vs a futuristic state. Organizations define tangible goals for growth, but this area lacked enough focus to measure the goals! That’s where a focused competence development & management approach garnered such significance in these times. In the Mobility industry, safety is an important objective for organizations. Standards like EN50128 (approved by CENELEC), ISO9001 & IEC61508 make it necessary to demonstrate & manage the competence of personnel, apart from stringent quality aspects.

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">What is Competency?</h3>  
        <img class="img-fluid img-colored" src="newTheme/img/talevo-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Sensing this need, a competency management system, Talevo (erstwhile CMS) was conceptualized & developed inhouse by Advanta Pune Mobility team members. What started as an idea, has evolved into a system which was rolled out in the ADVANTA Pune Mobility team in Oct’20 and is being rolled out to various departments across Mobility, Siemens. </p>
        <p>Talevo allows building a strategic talent management approach to define and track the competencies required for successfully delivering an organization’s business strategy. With this strategy, you can answer the following questions:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <ul>
          <li>Leadership Team - Which competencies does my organization / department need to achieve  desired business outcomes?</li>
          <li>Manager - Do I have the right competencies in my team to deliver project objectives?</li>
          <li>Employee - What competencies should I improve/build to fulfill my development targets?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-colored" src="newTheme/img/talevo-2.jpg" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Today, Talevo has been rolled out in MO, IT HUB, COBRA departments in Pune, while rollout is in progress for Hungary & Development Factory, RI, Germany. The rollout pipeline looks promising with France and Slovakia having expressed interest apart from interest exhibited by multiple stakeholders across the globe.</p>

            Imagine an employee struggling to deliver a project due to it requiring new skills and being unaware of whom to consult for technical issues. Think from the perspective of a manager of a team who has worked hard to ensure delivery despite skill gaps. Could he eliminate those risks or get the right people/expert help at the right time? How do we become a learning & future-ready organization with the talent we have in these VUCA times?

This product is developed to ensure competencies are captured, tracked, and updated in a transparent and easy way to help the site, department, and employees succeed. Talevo is an instrument to uncover gaps in the current state and empower users for quicker decisions to realize the organization’s vision. </p>
        <p>The rollout for Talevo in SMO DT IT HUB started on November 1st, 2020, and the date of handover to operations was decided as 15th February 2021. Within these timelines, all the modules comprising employee profile management, competency-based employee search, competency management, and competency review were scheduled to be completed. The HUB management decided to delegate the responsibility of Talevo Rollout to two project managers, Bhunesh Bhaskar & Abhishek Tripathi, from the Infrastructure Services team headed by Samarth Karnekar. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col idea-box__col idea-box--alt">
        <p style="align-self: flex-start;">Since both these project managers had recently joined the organization, it was a great opportunity for them to showcase their project management skills. This rollout also gave them an opportunity to connect with their colleagues and team managers from different verticals within the HUB. Dividing all the activities into parallel work packages and adherence to timelines meant that the rollout was completed well within the given timeline. Post the successful implementation of this competency management system other business units and teams have started adopting the tool with the help of SMO DT IT HUB as a role model.</p>

        <p>Every big move on a new platform comes with a price tag. Saving on cloud maintenance holds a huge cost appeal, but migration can be so much more than that since migration projects run on three different costs – On-premises, Online, and Project and the efficiency saving comes with early ramp-down of legacy environment.</p>
        
        <p>With an accelerated project approach, we were able to bring down the costs by nearly 31%. </p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">The Accelerated Approach</h3>    
        <p>We decided to onboard SharePoint consultants from Infosys and IBM, helping us migrate medium and highly complex sites in parallel with the partner appointed by Siemens IT – Atos –  to migrate simple sites. It also became easier to define the right priorities to migrate first, starting from sites that required minimal effort but generated high cost.</p>

        <p>Another major contributor was an efficient housekeeping survey performed via a small application, which resulted in the deletion of 20% of sites that were no longer in use.</p>
        
        <p>Communication and structured migration processes played a critical role, keeping our users up-to-date and offering a central application to get the live migration status of their respective sites.</p>
        <p>All the different strategies, plans, and actions resulted in 50% ram-down already - a pioneer among all Siemens organizations.</p>
