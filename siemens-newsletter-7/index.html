        <p>Dear All,<p>
        <p>It's been 4 months since the last installment of Mobility Pune Newsletter. So, here we are with the Sixth Edition of the Newsletter. This quarter we saw COVID making a roaring comeback. Hope everyone is taking necessary precautions , protecting themselves adequately and taking all the necessary steps to tide over the 2nd wave.<p>
        <p>We live in <span class="color--dark-blue font-weight-bold">V</span>olatile, <span class="color--dark-blue font-weight-bold">U</span>ncertain, <span class="color--dark-blue font-weight-bold">C</span>omplex, <span class="color--dark-blue font-weight-bold">A</span>mbiguous times. Having delivered a commendable performance in spite of all challenges, the focus across all 3 groups within Pune Mobility umbrella has been on growth. We as an organization are moving away from traditional ways of career & personal growth planning with adoption of GrowthTalks. The current issue hence has "Growth in VUCA times" as the underlying theme.<p>
        <p>We start this edition with writeup by Shrikant Vachaspati on "Growth Talks" providing us an Outside In perspective. You will find insightful write ups from various projects taking growth journey in the "Growth Stories" section. We have also streamlined the structure of the newsletter a bit to accomodate more content as we now have all 3 groups Mobility Advanta, Mobility IT Hub & COBRA contributing equally.<p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Over the last few editions, the newsletter has been shared by you with many of your global counterparts. In order to make the distribution easier we now are publishing newsletter first in Web format, following up with a PDF version. This should help make sharing the newsletter a little easier</p>
        <p>As usual we look forward to your inputs to make the newsletter more interesting, useful & readable. Please do not hesitate to provide feedback in the feedback form.</p>
        <p>Hope you all stay safe, stay positive & continue doing wonderful things that you have been doing during these challenging times</p>

          <p>In its simplest form, a Growth Talk is purely a future-focused exchange between people that results in learning and progress toward a goal. The shared objectives of all exchanges is to be development-oriented and performance enhancing.</p>

          <p>Faster business cycles and new challenges demand a growth mindset—staying curious, being resilient, experimenting, and adapting. To strengthen our performance through individual growth​, we need a mindset change.</p> 

          <p>We replace our system-driven annual processes with engaging, jointly-driven conversations that focus on individual growth and drive business success. These conversations and exchanges can be approached in many different ways, depending on the situation. This is the Growth Talks approach.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Just-in-time recognition allows intentional reinforcement of behaviors we want to encourage</li>

              <p>The new normal after COVID is in everybody’s mind. Also, in our COBRA management team, we are frequently discussing how this new normal can and should look like. For sure, the old nine to six, five days a week in office will not return post-COVID. Especially in our organization, we learned what can be done without being in the office at all and without meeting colleagues in person.</p>

          <p> However, although the operational interaction is going smoothly working from remote, the lack of real social interaction will likely be taking its toll in the long run. I still believe that you can only develop a real bonding and team spirit if colleagues meet in person at least once in a while and a bit more in the beginning.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the COBRA management team took the initiative and held the first Cobra line management face-to-face workshop ever in Bengaluru from July 29 to 30. I have to admit that I was really excited to see most of my managers for the first time after more than a year. Sanjay and Anuj I knew from the past, but Sakthi, Raij and Sai I have never met before. Only Kay and Niko, who are still in Germany, had to dial in. All being routine business people, we realized that we had become a bit “rusty”. I couldn’t remember when it was the last time that I wore a shirt. Others said it took them ages to pack their bag for these 2 days because things that were at hand all the time in the past now had disappeared somewhere in drawers because they were not used anymore.</p>
          <p>But it was not just about meeting face to face. We had many topics to discuss, mostly related to our staff. Again we discussed possible concepts for the new normal. The employee survey results and how to address them properly were also on the agenda, just to mention a few topics. Some of the results will be</p>

          <p>presented during our upcoming online management information session. We also had the opportunity to meet and interact with the project team of BMRCL, and we appreciate their efforts despite the pandemic and the current challenges in the project. </p>
          <p>Overall it was a great experience after such a long time, and I hope that all of us will be getting the opportunity to meet in person soon.</p>

        <p>Dear All,</p>
        <p>Happy to interact with you for the sixth time through our quarterly newsletter. I am glad that we have accepted that we are living in VUCA times! I have been talking about this for more than a decade now. It is not a transient state but is here to stay. This has happened not just because of geopolitical and economic reasons but also due to emerging technologies. I see this as a renaissance!</p>

        <p>Let us learn to appreciate, adapt, and apply ourselves to contribute to upsurge collectively. During these changing times, our vision has not changed. We see ourselves to be the top software house within Mobility.</p>

        <p>The overall market situation is demanding, with customers expecting more with less. Our efforts to provide cost-competitive and high-quality solutions will certainly lend support there. But what we need to develop and enhance is our competency to handle end-to-end solutions. We have understood that this is possible only if product, Development, Technology, Infrastructure, Business Excellence, HR, and BA teams work collaboratively, with each having a higher degree of competence in respective functions.</p>

        <p>I feel proud that during these times, we have not let the ball drop. In fact, as individuals and as a collective, we have demonstrated dedication, support, willingness to help and most importantly, willingness to meet challenges!</p>

        <p>Our product organization, aka LHS, has worked relentlessly to pursue opportunities with excellent support from SMO and ADVANTA management. We have been able to win some opportunities such as Delhi Metro, SILTS, and NYQBL train monitoring in the space of IEB. At the same time, we have started our engagement in additional CORE topics, for example, Simis W, WESTLOCK, UDS, SCOT tool development, Taiwan Unit testing, EOT, and DSM." This would not have been possible without proactive support from MOTO and Development teams. This is exactly what we need in an organization with a growth mindset.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>To increase our partner's confidence in us, we will have to develop bootstrap models for productivity, agility, and quality. This is only possible if we continue to invest in talent acquisition, development, and retention. The leadership team at different levels is taking multiple actions to understand and address it transparently. What we now need the most is connection, grit, and gumption! We should also continue to think and act like a startup with a large organization.</p>
        <p>I thank all of you again for your continued positive contributions, dedication & focus. Stay healthy, stay safe!</p>

          <p>Dear all,</p>
 
          <p>What an interesting year 2020 was! For Mobility IT, it was a rollercoaster ride with lots of ups and downs but more importantly, we kept moving forward.</p>
           
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>We started our journey in the middle of the lockdown last year and had our first remote joiner in the last week of June 2020.</p>

        <p>Now, as of April 2021, we are a team of more than 50 bright-minded colleagues, all onboarded fully virtually and performing excellently without meeting each other face to face even once! I believe this has never been done before within a house of Siemens and I take pride in all the accomplishments our team was able to achieve.</p>
        
        <p>Talking about accomplishments, in the last quarter, we did successful insourcing of PLM services from Atos, in time and in scope, and now our PLM team is fully delivering those services out of our IT HUB in Pune. This has resulted in better quality control over the service offerings and optimized efforts on service delivery. Our infrastructure team also successfully completed a global SharePoint migration project that resulted in improved efficiency, cost optimization, and scalability. There are many more such accomplishments and I am sure that there will be many more in the times to come.</p>
 
        <p>As part of our growth plans, we are planning on doubling our strength by the end of FY21. From a team of 50, we will become a team of 100 plus members in 7 months. This shows that we have a robust demand pipeline and support from global Siemens Mobility management to grow further. With offices remaining closed for more than a year now, all of this will need to be achieved virtually. Managing a team of more than 100+ bright minds completely virtually is a challenge as well as a new opportunity in itself.</p>

          <p>Many thanks to all those who have contributed to this journey. Looking forward to your continued support.</p>

        <p>One of the key activities that happened in the last quarter was the discussions between the COBRA Steering Committee & COBRA team. The discussion involved presentations and addresses by technical and commercial business segment leaders of Main Line (Ricardo Ramos and Nusha Heit), Mass Transit (Marc Ludwig and Ishita Aggarwal) Electrification (Markus Zachmeier and Bernd Blumenstein). The main topics covered in these meetings were a self-introduction of the segment leaders to the Cobra team, elaboration on activities for each respective segment into which the Cobra team is involved followed, segment financials followed by a Q&A session.</p>

        <p>A COBRA town hall which was held by the RI business leaders Andre Rodenbeck and Eva Scherer concluded the meeting session. After introducing themselves Andre and Eva gave an insight on the RI business perspective as well as on the rationale behind the creation of Cobra. They also shared the following slide on their expectation towards the Cobra employees:</p>

        <p>I could say that these sessions have reduced the gaps between the newly formed COBRA team in India and the leaders of various departments across the globe who has been the main pillars of COBRA. The question that was mostly asked by the participants is that “What is COBRA in your view?” and the answers given by the moderators has made us understand the real motto behind COBRA and has enhanced our way of perceiving the importance of this new group. Thanks for all the leaders for the interest they have shown in answering the queries and for their valuable time.</p>

              <p> I was facilitating an interac- tive session with school going students under the banner of ‘Shikshak Prab- hodhini’ – a project where teachers are being trained to mentor exceptional students. We were discuss- ing ‘emotions’. A young girl of eighth standard, an aspir- ing singer, was discussing with me her emotions before a performance, in front of about 80 other students. We talked about the ‘Result’ and the ‘Process’. The ‘result’ was the end of the performance when the audience would clap and appreciate. The ‘Process’ was the actual perfor- mance that would lead to this result.</p>

          <p>We concluded that before starting the actual performance we need to make the ‘result’ ‘out of focus’ that is blurred and bring the actual performance in sharp focus ... by sharp focus we meant, we will now focus on every minute of the performance... minute by minute. The girl visualized aloud the exact moment of starting the performance. She described it as if in a trance, I was helping her to shape her responses ... Here she was, as steady as a rock ... breathing rhythmically.. Image of her guru in front of her eyes ... and the only overriding thought, I am going to do my best...</p>
          <p>“And who are you? ... what are you? ... at this moment? ...”</p>
          <p>“I am music ...” pat came the reply</p>
          <p>“A moment of excellence is born” I said.</p>
          <p>It was a very strong experience emotionally for all of us pres- ent. A rare, delightful insight into an experience called ‘excellence’ ... It was exhilarating in an enlightened manner.
          At times, the experiential truth is so strong that is difficult to catch it in words, however, if one has to consolidate the emotional insight into a blinding design of wisdom, one has to fall back on words again.</p>
          <h4>So what is excellence?</h4>
          <p>I do not think excellence has one single definition. In the future segments of this communication, I will explore different ways by which this theme can be understood. Here is the first one.</p>


        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
          <p>Let us take for example, a popular skill amongst students such as ‘orator’s skill’. Translated in school-reality, it means participating and winning elocution and debat- ing competitions.</p>
          
          
          <p>A student that is generally chosen by teachers for developing this skill is an exprand communicative one who also has a ‘pleasant’ and ‘smart ‘disposition’.
          Suppose there is an elocution competition and five topics are given, out of which she has to select one. The mentor here will ask her to think and talk about each one of the topics ... what are the thoughts that come to her mind when she reads topics such as , ‘Protecting My
           Earth’ or ‘The Life and Times of Shivaji Maharaj’ . She is encouraged to explore each topic; in her own way. She has to just go on talking about each topic. The mentor listens keenly.</p>

          <p>“Can you now make a choice?” the mentor asks the question unconstructively. She needs to give her own explanation why she is deciding to opt for a particular topic. If she is confused, the mentor helps her to explore her confusion (please note, not to clear it).</p>

          <p>When she makes a choice she has to give justification for it. Having heard that; the mentor poses certain relevant queries regarding her choice. What is the most important aspect of the topic that she has liked? What according to her is the part of the topic that she may find difficult? If she has ‘liked’ two topics, what is one consideration that will help her to choose the one that she has chosen?</p>

          <p>Controlguide Foresight (Hereafter referred to as Foresight) came into existence as a new product, independent of the current diagnostic tool (CTF-Controlguide Technician Facility) and the Control centre systems. Owned by UK R&D, Foresight will improve Siemens customer service by offering a remote diagnostic application that can be run in a portable device or a web browser to make information available to both the maintainers in the field as well as managers (or duty engineers) in offices and/or ROCs. This will help the diagnosis, the clearance of faults, and alarm management.  </p>

        <p>The application should be independent of trackside technology. In addition to fault finding and alert indications, it can also provide geolocation information of where the closest depot or access points are. An expert system will support issue resolution, giving guidance on how to solve the problem, what spares to carry, manuals and video tutorials, etc. It was also decided that to reduce the development time and costs and potential cybersecurity issues, the analytics/logic will remain in the secure safety signaling network. Simultaneously, the diagnostic data will be collected, stored, and used to provide diagnostic information to the final users using Siemens MindSphere® IoT Operating System Platform.</p>

          The topic is now selected.</p>
          <p>The mentor now motivates the student to gather information on the topic. The mentor shares the spirit of enquiry, exploration and excitement. Having an adequate ‘database’ the mentor helps the student to evolve the structure of presentation. The structure is not imposed. Any deviation from standard procedure of delivering a speech, is respected and discussed. </p>

The drive for achieving bigger goals and moving ahead has been a constant human endeavor. And it does not matter what level you peg your goals; the aim is to do better than what you are doing now. There are many forces that work on us in influencing this growth, both internal  and external. And in a world that is now VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity) in its nature, the external forces have multiplied, both in number and impact.</p>

          <p>The mentor and the student now discuss the style of presentation. The mentor does not impose his or any other’s style on the student. They make a list of ‘impressive orators’ that they have observed in media as well as in public life. The student makes note of the qualities that she would like to imbibe from each one of them. The written draft is taken as a guideline rather than a script.</p>
          <p>While rehearsing the speech, placement of all phrases and points is discussed. The contents are rearranged, realigned and the impact is noted.
          Then the student is given different scenarios and told to present the speech</p>
          <ul>
          <li> Student is the first speaker</li>

          <p>Each performance is discussed.</p>

          <p>Then the ‘emotions’ during preparation and rehearsal are discussed. Boredom, anxiety, satisfaction...Each emotion is named and each emotion is acknowledged. The emotions that will help the performance are identified. How can the student continue to generate these helpful emotions? ... different strategies are planned by which this can be done.</p>

        <p> The issue of ‘ownership’ of performance is now discussed. This ‘ownership’ can be burdening or enjoyable, the way you look at it.
          On the day of the performance, the mentor and the student spend a short ‘exclusive time’ together.
          After the performance the mentor and the student discuss pros and cons of her own performance. Rather than saying “your delivery was too fast”, it is put as “These were the sentences where your speed was fast” Rather than saying “you need to work on your eye-to-eye contact” it is put as, “you need to periodically cover all corners of the audience by your eyes”.</p>
          

          <p>After the performance is discussed, both mentor and student sincerely sit through some other contestants’ speeches and discuss those. Slowly they evolve a detailed format of performance appraisal which is kept as a record by the student. After the result of the competition, the mentor
          explores resultant emotions with the student. They decide on their next goal.</p>

          <p>As the time progresses, the student starts becoming more responsible and empowered and the mentor maintains a meaningful presence through- out this journey.</p>

          <p>The student now grows confident and starts exploring the experience further. The mentor now focuses on ‘involvement’, ‘commitment’, ‘process satisfaction’ and ‘result satisfaction’ which are psychologically more sophisticated terms.</p>

          <p>The discussion revolves around, what is the ‘self-talk’ at such times and how different types of self-talk can be either helpful or harmful; how the student can exercise her choice to choose the most helpful self-talk.</p>

            <p>The student is at her best at that moment. This moment is again shared and explored by both. It is a magical moment. A touch of brilliance.

            The mentor watches with his ever-watchful eyes her track-record of glories with moist eyes, with all the memories gathering one by one in his mind... “There was a day when I helped her to make her choice” he says in his mind and smiles.</p>

          <p>Last year, when the pandemic hit us and remote working became the new normal, one challenge that we faced was lack of face to face connections. While within teams, virtual events like the daily scrum meeting, Fun on Fridays ensured some amount of interaction, connection with the leadership was still missing to a great extent. That is where MO Virtual Gemba Walk came in, as an attempt to bridge this gap.</p>
          <p>MO Virtual Gemba Walk, is an online forum which brings project teams and leadership together. It’s a place to have some fun, learn from each other and surface some of the pressing needs of the team. This forum encourages teams to share some of their challenges where the leadership team can step in and assist in addressing them.
          Teams who have undergone the MO Virtual Gemba Walk so far are: GUIDO, Rail9000, ITS-US, ITS-SAM, ITS-DCS, OIL, MDA, MCR, ATO, PTC, CBTC, ZUB, UTC, TGMT, DPS, RBC-Adapter. 
          Following are some experiences shared by the leadership and project team members:</p>
          <h4>Mukul - ITS</h4>
          <p>GEMBA is a very interesting and engaging platform to observe, engage and learn with our colleagues. This gives us an opportunity to gain more knowledge about the product, process and people. Teams have been coming up with interesting ideas to have an insightful, meaningful and fun discussion with Leadership. Through all the GEMBA walks we have been able to find our Strengths and Areas of Improvements. Our Coaches have been instrumental in order to ensure the implementation of the Action Plan along with Team Support. Let us continue to reap benefits of this Open Dialogue Platform for our continuous improvement</p>

        <div class="col-md-4 info__col idea-box__col idea-box--alt">
          <h4>Vishal Gaikwad – DPS</h4>
          <p>I personally like the new format of “virtual” GEMBA walk, which was a kind of get-to-know-you and improved social connect where people could openly share their thoughts and hear views from Nikhil and Bala. The derived outcomes and actions would certainly help the DPS team to know more about the future roadmap and opportunities in MO at the same time, the leadership to know more about various happenings in the DPS space.</p>
          <h4>Nisha Konnamparambath - CBTC</h4>
          <p>GEMBA walk gave the entire team an opportunity to interact with Nikhil. The whole design of the meeting is to make the exercise as fun-filled as it can be, and the team thoroughly enjoyed the session. On top of our regular retrospectives, it gave us an opportunity to look at where we stand as a team. This resulted in identifying improvement areas and deriving action items, some of which helped us in overall advancement of CBTC as a team in the right direction. We hope to have more such sessions for the team in the future too.</p>
          <h4>Umesh Barshikar – Mass Transit</h4>
          <p>Gemba walk gives a very good platform for the team to directly interact with the leadership about topics that are important to them. The ones that I was part of were very open and everyone was encouraged to speak openly without any bias. It was conducted in a very light but professional manner given enough opportunity to all the participants. Some very interesting suggestions, points came up for discussion during this initiative and it was followed up by creating a dashboard to follow up on the action items.</p>

          <h4>#InThisTogether</h4>

          <p>Project teams require a supportive environment of process set-up, agility, system checks, safety and compliance assurance for a seamless delivery. </p>
          <p>This is where all the three teams in BE come together to enable the project delivery. Firstly, the QM team helps to set-up the base of processes for safety/non-safety based on Safety Integrity Levels, project scope, and ensures the adherence leading to good quality product. The SDS team coaches the project teams to add value delivery through discovery of best practices during execution with built-in quality and faster delivery. Finally, the RAMS team helps in validating the safety requirements right from definition of requirements to understanding how the product meets the agreed safety norms at the end of lifecycle.</p>

          <p>With an eye on some operational challenges and future improvements, SMO Management has planned to standup a mechanical CAD (MCAD) support team at Pune centre. COVID-19 situation and Lockdowns forced us to rethink this plan. Still, management has decided to go for a completely Virtual Onboarding and successfully onboarded 12 Team members for PDMLink and Conversion team in Pune centre within 4 to 6 months.</p>

          <p>While we never imagined onboarding to a new job virtually, we are happy to report that things are going just smooth in the new normal. </p>

        <p>As we were located in different parts of India and our team is thousands of miles away from us in Europe, we felt much pressure - sometimes worrying if we made the right decision or not, by changing jobs when the whole world is in COVID-19 and the financial crisis. </p>
        <p>SMO Management and HR team helped to relieve some of this pressure by their caring approach towards new employees from the very first week. Virtual sessions like All Hand meetings, Buddy Talks, talks with CIO, Daily standups, Weekly team meetings, Jour Fixes, and German coaching helped build positive momentum in all teams to work together. </p>
        <p>We were also provided a one-time amount to set up home office furniture and IT accessories. Yoga and workout sessions were planned considering employee health and comfort.</p>
        <p> Good planning for knowledge sharing sessions and keeping breathing space between the sessions to digest the knowledge was essential. Also, there was enough overlap in Passive and Active shadowing with the ATOS Team to completely and successfully take over the ownership of the SMO MCAD support services starting from 1st January 2021.</p>
        <p>Insourcing will help us to take more ownership, raise flexibility, improve collaboration, lower overall cost and support our Business Units in a better way. Plans for the future are currently a major PLM system upgrade and the implementation of Teamcenter as our new PLM platform. Thank you to every member of SMO to make this Journey successful </p>

         2020 has been that year which taught us the importance of the above quote. It has completely changed the way most of us work. Our relationships with our colleagues have been redefined. Going for lunch together, having a cup of tea at the local tapri, celebrating birthdays – usually, these were the moments that helped us grow from a group of individuals to a team. Covid-19 has prevented us from enjoying such real-life moments, and it seems it might continue to do so for a while. However, this does not mean that we stop growing and connecting.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>The initial days of work from home were a huge adjustment, but we all learned to adapt ourselves. As part of this journey, we moved our day-to-day practices from the real world to this virtual world. Being part of a team meant a lot of things. A day in the office for our team generally started with the daily scrum meeting. Our first order of business was to conduct this online. Tracking this in such a way that the status is visible to all the stakeholders was very important.</p>
        <p>We now have a daily 15-minute standup facilitated by our Scrum Master, wherein each team member gives an update of the task they are working on using the RTC dashboard. In the absence of the scrum master, any team member steps up to conduct the same. This is true for all the agile ceremonies such as the Sprint review, Sprint retrospective and backlog grooming. </p>

        <p>It has been a continuous learning process to time box ourselves. However, we feel that the daily standup is essential for us as this is a required human connection we need to kick start our day.</p>
        <p>During the past year, we also had a successful release. This would not have been possible without the entire team's joint effort. In the beginning, it was a bit overwhelming to figure out how to work together virtually. We had a bit of a shaky start, but finally, we set ourselves a new rhythm.</p>

        <p>We learnt to break the tasks down into smaller stories to achieve better sprint velocity, spend more time in understanding the requirements together so that we could work on them individually, squinted away at the fine print-</p>

        <p>  of a screen shared during a call to discuss and debug solutions all the while keeping the goal of the release in mind. Siemens also ensured that we could grow individually by giving us access to different pieces of training and certifications. Team members have completed various activities such as IMS, AI/ML, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Being at home unable to interact with others does take its toll, though. Different people went through different emotional upheavals. However, we have always tried to maintain an open communication line, be it among ourselves or with our managers. We had talks wherein each team member openly spoke about the difficulties and challenges they were facing, and we tried figuring out how we could make things better for them. Every day we have a DND ( Do not disturb) time zone wherein we keep aside an hour roughly. It is the me-time for each individual wherein he/she is free to do whatever they want. It could be completing some housework, resting for some time or even just completing an individual task without having anyone disturb them at that time. </p>

        <p>As the saying goes, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". It was essential during these trying times to maintain the team spirit. We started with a Fun Friday every sprint where the entire team gets together and plays games. Before Covid-19, we would never have imagined that we would have had so much fun playing games such as Dumb Charades, Treasure Hunt, Fun Quizzes, Pictionary, Antakshari, Bingo! so many more virtually. Everyone participates wholeheartedly, and there is a competitive spirit like when we were kids! It's been a challenge to figure out something new each time, but the fun, happiness, stress release and bonding that takes place is a delight.</p>
        <p>We have had at least three new members join the team during this time, and we found that having such events was the best way to make them feel comfortable and welcome them into the team. </p>

        <p>No matter how big or small, we should celebrate and appreciate occasions and people. Appreciation cards have been doing the rounds for the excellent work an individual or the team has put in. At the same time, we have had many other reasons to celebrate, be it birthdays, marriages, anniversaries or births, we have been blessed. Not being able to celebrate in the office together did not stop us, however. Every birthday is celebrated with a small video filled with wishes and funny moments. We get together on call and sing Happy Birthday ( though we still haven't learnt how to sing together 😉 ) and pull each other's legs.</p>

          <p>Traffic congestion is becoming a critical issue day by day. This is due to the increased urbanization, industrialization, and vehicle density. Sometimes emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks are stuck in traffic and unable to reach in time for rescue.  </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>The worst traffic jams or long queues occur at intersections where cars, bikes, buses, or pedestrians cross the road. If we can manage traffic at such intersections, we might resolve this issue significantly. Almost all big cities have traffic signals and a dedicated traffic police force for managing everyday traffic. In case of emergencies, the police can use a traffic control panel to make dynamic signal changes or take control over intersection traffic manually.</p>
        
        <p>
          "Vehicle-Actuated Signals" is one of the preferred methods for optimizing intersection traffic. There are also various detectors used for actuation. e.g., inductive loop detectors, radar, RFID, or cameras. 
        </p>

          <span class="img-caption">Vehicle-Actuated Signals</span>  
        </p>
        <p>Signal controller programs take these detector actuations as input from all approach lanes and dynamically adjust the signal timing plan and reduce queue length on all lanes as much as possible.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>These steps help reduce congestion time significantly. Some cities have preferred special vehicle detection mechanisms to detect emergency vehicles and public transport vehicles to prioritize cross intersections.  </p> 

        <p>Typically, traffic signal controllers operate in three modes.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-Timed Signal:</strong> In this mode, a traffic signal's Green-Amber-Red timing is fixed, and these patterns are repeated throughout the day. Sometimes, these fixed timing partners or designs are based on historical traffic scenarios. An example can be giving more time to the green signals in the morning, especially those that lead to offices or industrial areas. This will ensure the smooth movement of traffic.</p>

        <p><strong>Actuated Signal:</strong>  In this method, one can use vehicle detectors to detect traffic based on queue length, vehicle type, and priority; based on these factors, signal controllers can optimize signal timing dynamically. Taking the same scenario as above, if there is more traffic moving towards the office or industrial area, a lane could get maximum green time dynamically.</p>

          <p><strong>Mixed-Mode:</strong>   One can use this mode at major and minor traffic road junctions. Typically, major roads have fixed timing, and minor roads get actuated signals. By doing this, minor roads will get a green signal when there is sizable traffic. Otherwise, you end up prioritizing just major-road traffic.</p>

          Disadvantages of Actuated Signals
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If the traffic demand pattern is very regular, the extra benefit of adding local actuation is minimal or non-existent.</li>
          <li>Installation cost is two to three times the cost of a pre-timed signal installation.</li>
          <li>Actuated controllers are much more complicated than pre-timed controllers, increasing maintenance costs.</li>
          <li>They require careful inspection & maintenance to ensure proper operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Traffic engineers are coming up with newer concepts like Signal Synchronization, which allows coordinating traffic signals along a single route so that vehicles get a progressive green signal at each junction. This is another crucial aspect that we will discuss more in the upcoming newsletter.  </p>

            I started my journey in Ansible playbook automation with the idea of moving away from traditional script automation tools and deployment models on virtual machines to something more simple, sequential, agent-less, and powerful in terms of configuration management and workflow orchestration required in a Cloud environment. And Ansible was the answer.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>Below is the step by step guide on how to get started with playbook creation, execution, and troubleshooting in Ansible:</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Creating a Playbook — Know-How:</h3>

        <p>I began my first playbook creation by converting the existing Network Shell script for product installation on a virtual machine in a Cloud environment to a playbook. Playbooks are expressed in YAML format and mostly consist of a series of sequential ‘tasks’. At a very basic level, a task is nothing more than a call to an Ansible module, which is a predefined set of system commands, resources, etc.
        To have an overview of playbook creation, here is the official link to the documentation: AnsiblePlaybooks</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Steps to execute playbook:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li> The first step in executing a playbook is to check for any syntax errors while writing the playbook <br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml -- syntax-check/</pre></li>
          <li> Below is the step to execute a playbook <br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml</pre></li>
          <li> For detailed debugging step by step for a playbook use this command:<br/>
          <pre>* ansible-playbook test.yml -- step -vv</pre></li>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
       <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Troubleshooting a playbook:</h3>

        <p>The most common errors faced while executing a playbook are:</p>
        
        <p><strong>1. No such file or directory</strong></p>
        
        <p>— Usually, for this kind of error, you need to look if the file is executable by checking the permissions of the file.</p>
        <p>— Another thing to check is if you are running the playbook as a root user or any other non-root Ansible user which has the required privileges to execute the playbook.</p>
        <p>— Another basic error could be that the file is not copied properly to the target server before execution</p>

        <p><strong>2. Permissions denied</strong></p>
        <p>— You may need to check if the user ID you’re using to execute the playbook on the server has the correct permissions to execute the playbook or if you need to root otherwise.</p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Best practices to be followed:</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li> Copy the required sh script, tar, zip files, and whatever else is required for installation of any of the software/products on the virtual machines for which we are writing the Ansible playbook in the proper folder structure in your GIT repository.</li>

          <ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">

            <li> It is a best practice to provide the name of all the tasks which are performed in the playbook to increase the readability for another user.</li>

            <li> Always mention the target hosts in your playbook at the top before beginning the actual playbook. Please make sure to also add the same in /etc/ansible.cfg file on the main server.</li>

            <li> If you’re stuck with any command while developing a playbook, use the official guide at docs.ansible.com to look for the command, along with its syntax and various parameters. For e.g. for executing a shell script via an Ansible playbook, we have two modules available in Ansible: Shell module and Script module.</li>

        <p>The last year or so has seen all of us evolve. We have learnt to work, collaborate, survive & flourish in ways different from the ways we followed earlier. This evolution has been challenging, often making us throw many of the long held assumptions out of the window. The R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program has been no exception to this.</p>

        <p>We launched the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program a couple of years back in order to help us be ready for many of the industry 4.0 challenges & also to help us be better prepared for the growth that we were foreseeing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p> Over the last 24 months, especially the year 2020, we have seen the need to decentralize, go virtual & distributed to answer the needs of these challenging times. R<small>N</small>D NG(Next Generation) is the next evolution of the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program in this direction. However, before we talk about what has changed, let's quickly look back at 2020 from R<small>N</small>D 4.0 perspective.</p>
        
        <img src="newTheme/img/rnd-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid img-colored">
 
        <p>We evolved the program to suit the virtual world. Some of the initiatives had to be discontinued, some evolved & some new ones got added. We continued to get together to listen to technical presentations every alternate week in Tech Break Sessions. Having crossed a half century of the sessions, we took a short break from Tech Break & have returned in the new year with a new set of topics. ToastMasters club has now more than 75 sessions under its belt. It continues on a fortnightly basis. CI/CD initiative saw significant improvement in CI/CD maturity of the 10 targeted projects. The initiative is now being owned by DevOPS team.</p>
         
        <p>We did a very interesting domain express session on Tunnel Management. We have also found the limitations of the virtual world to do events like domain express. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>That has not stopped us from exchanging bits of knowledge oriented topics. Through ITS Quiz, Domain Quiz, Testing Bytes & Did You Know we have tried to bring around interesting bits of information & trivia to you. We launched domain dictionary to make it easy for you to get detailed understanding & information about various domain related topics.</p>

        <p>You continue to express your appreciation for all your colleagues through appreciation cards which saw a redesign this year. We have piloted a new innovation management process that is based on Shout Out Circles.</p>

        <p> Getting feedback from people is important to keep making things better. Various mechanisms like virtual Gemba walk, Project Reflections, and Retro Appetizers were used to collect the feedback which could be used for decision making at various levels. We have worked on streamlining the procurement process for hardware items to make life better for requesters as well as approvers.</p>

        <p>This newsletter, which is published every quarter, is also one of the initiatives within the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program. Now we have participation from all 3 Mobility groups based out of Pune. The newsletter is shared & appreciated globally.</p>
 
        <p>As we are taking this journey, we have also realized the need to distribute and align better. With that in mind we are reshaping the R<small>N</small>D 4.0 program into R<small>N</small>D NG program. While the core values and way of working remains the same, the R<small>N</small>D NG program will have more participation from the G0T0 team. At least 2 G0T0 members have become champions for each of the levers.</p>

          Magnification in train control system
        </h3>
        <div class="info__main-content">
          <p>Metro Signalling & Train control system technology focus means of reducing headway, ensuring safety, and improving efficiency and reduction in the cost of operation. The Signalling & Train Control system on Main Line Railways and Metros are different on account of very different traffic requirements besides civil and E&M infrastructure. Signalling & Train Control in metros not only ensures train safety, but it also integrates, interfaces, and automates areas of operation, driving, passenger information, collection of information, and analysis of the same. Signalling & Train Control systems have been dominated using Track Circuit-based Signalling & Train Control for more than five decades.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        
        <p>The success of Metro rail systems lies in their ability to provide frequent, fast, safe, and comfortable journeys in the urban conglomeration, not only to the regular commuters but also to the occasional traveler or tourist alike. Signalling and Train Control systems play a major role in achieving these objectives. While enhancing operational efficiency by providing control systems to achieve the target headway, it also always ensures the total safety of the train movements besides adding value to other systems by the on-line interface.</p>
        <p>The rapid developments in the computer and microcircuit technology, as well as telecommunication, have led to the development of Integrated Metro Control systems, in which computers (including failsafe forms of computers) fulfill many of the decision making roles traditionally performed by Train operators, station controllers, Traffic controllers, etc., eventually leading to the introduction of highly automated Metro Rail with driverless trains.</p>
        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">Need for Train detection and methods used: </h3>
        <p>To convey information to a train about where to stop and at what speed to run required all the trains on any line to be detected automatically by the system. This was achieved by the invention of the so-called “Track circuits”. Track circuits were first invented in the USA (DC Track circuits) in 1872 and later picked up and improved by British railways. London Underground was the first large-scale user in a Metro rail network 1904-06.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
         <p>The need to provide information to train resulted in the invention of “Coded Track circuits” with modulation of a basic AC carrier with codes. These required insulated joints between sections of rails like earlier track circuits for demarcating the individual track circuit blocks. Later came the “Jointless Track circuits” which use audio frequencies and provide high impedance between adjacent track circuits by a tuning process thus avoiding the need for insulated joints. These are commonly called Audio frequency Track Circuits (AFTC) and these help in transmitting codes that modulate the basic AFTC carrier which in turn are picked up by an antenna suspended below the train. </p>
        <p>In addition to track circuits, another system called “Axle counter” is also used for train detection. In this method, axles are detected through a magnetic circuit linking a transmitter and a receiver across the rail, and whenever a metallic axle interposes the received signal drops are detected and counted as one pulse. In this manner, all the axles coming into one block are counted at the entry and if all the axles are counted out at the exit of the block the block is declared as clear.  </p>
        <p>In the latest advancement in Metro signalling, a system called Communication based train control (CBTC) has been in use for more than a decade. In this system, the primary train detection is purely based on a failsafe communication link between the train and the control center with the train communicating its position continuously and the control Centre communicates the position to other trains for maintaining the safety distance between two trains. Track circuits or axle counters if any are used only as a secondary detection in case the Metro operator desires a fallback system.</p>

            Characteristics of Communication-Based Train Control System (CBTC)
          </h3>
          <p>Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a railway signalling system that makes use of the telecommunications between the train and track equipment for traffic management and train control. CBTC systems enable, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signalling systems, which results more efficiently and safely to manage the railway traffic and improve headway.</p>
          <p>CBTC systems allow different levels of automation or Grades of Automation, GoA, as classified in the IEC 62290-1. CBTC is not a synonym for “driverless” or “automated trains” although it is considered as a basic technology for this purpose.</p>
          <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">
            Driverless Train Operation (DTO) and Unattended Train Operation (UTO): 
          </h3>            
          <p>More sophisticated systems free the driver from the need to be at the front of the train – referred to as Driverless Train Operation (DTO) or GOA level 3. In DTO the driver can move away from the front of the train but remains available to provide customer-facing duties and to drive the train in the event of a failure of the DTO/ATO system. </p>
          <p>As the driver is no longer able to see the route ahead this imposes a greater demand on guideway security and platform controls. </p>

        <p>Platform screen doors must be provided, to allow ATO to handle door closing also on the signal from ATP that all the Platform Screen Doors have closed fully. </p>
        
        <p>In DTO, train doors and train departure from a station platform may also be controlled automatically or manually from a location other than a driver cab at the front of the train. ATO can be given the operating instructions by the ATS regarding dwell time and hold for regulating the train on platforms as required by the operational situation and in the normal course, the driver wherever he happens to be on the train is relieved of all operational workload. </p>

        <p>CCTV information of the inside of coaches is transmitted live in new systems to OCC for controllers to observe for any untoward incidents inside the moving train and with other advancements in prevention and detection of unauthorized access to the viaduct or tunnel, even a separate train operator is no longer required on the cab in the train. The space required for the equipment could also be saved and passenger capacity increased at the end cabs. Thus, it became possible to have an Unattended Train Operation. Driverless ATO without an on-board attendant is referred to as Unattended Train Operation (UTO) or GOA level 4. UTO can range from empty train movements ( only to a siding, or in an automated depot, for example) to the operation of trains in passenger service with no attendant on board. The latter requires that the reliability of the systems has to be of a higher level and the train can be operated remotely under failure conditions, or at the minimum can be reached by shore-based personal in a short period.</p>

            Risks of CBTC
          </h3>
          <p>The primary risk of a CBTC system is that if the communications link between any of the trains is disrupted then all or part of the system might have to enter a failsafe state until the problem is remedied. Depending on the severity of the communication loss, this state can range from vehicles temporarily reducing speed, coming to a halt, or operating in a degraded mode until communications are re-established.</p>
          <p>Communications failures can result from equipment malfunction, electromagnetic interference, weak signal strength or saturation of the communications medium. In this case, an interruption can result in a service brake or emergency brake application as real-time situational awareness is a critical safety requirement for CBTC and if these interruptions are frequent enough it could seriously impact service.</p>
          <p>Cyber-physical challenge is the severe risk in this system. CBTC Systems that make use of open standards for wireless digital communications link have a much larger attack surface and can be subject to various types of hacking including intrusion of the communications network and tampering with safety-critical messages that, in the worst case, could result in a safety hazard.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        
        <p>CBTC systems may be designed with centralized supervision systems, to improve maintainability and reduce installation costs. If so, there is an increased risk of a single point of failure that could disrupt service over an entire system or line.</p>

          <p>According to me, innovation is creating something new or capturing some value-added ideas in a product/project/business for a specific problem statement. Innovation can be completely radical sometimes and sometimes just an improvement/enhancement. Innovation, which is non-obvious and novel in nature, is qualified for the IP.</p><p> I always like to do innovation, and for that, I always try to observe problems in the system as a whole. Whenever a valid problem statement is identified, then I work towards its solution. For me, innovation benefitted in different ways; most importantly, it allows learning and deeply understanding the product/project/domain. Innovation also helps to create synergy between the teams, and sometimes innovation also helps to accelerate the product growth as per the market need.</p>

          <p>I am K. Sakthisubramanian, joined as the Head of Engineering in the COBRA team. Being a part of the COBRA team where growth and development are the main goals, how it would be correct if GROWTH is not been voiced by me. So, I would like to share some thoughts and concepts of GROWTH in this article for everybody’s knowledge sake.</p>

      <p>The growth of an organization is not possible without having a strong goal, leadership with a vision and an enthusiastic team even if the funds are available.  Hence, when we talk about the growth of an organization it has the growth of the individuals in it which leads us to get a strong team with a leader. </p> 
      <p>Every time when I hear about “GROWTH”, the first thing which relates to me is the MINDSET.  The growth MINDSET which is a must need for the GROWTH of organization, individual career etc., </p>  
      <p>The Growth Mindset basically is about the way how every situation can be improved better through the previous experiences, lessons learnt and practices.  With a growth mindset, the failure is not considered as a detriment rather considered as a step closer to the success.   </p>
      <p>With the Growth mindset the organization and the individuals in the organization should start cultivating a strong culture of learning from every situation as the growth is a natural consequence of learning.  Regular discussions on the performances of the individuals need to be performed by the managers.  Leaders need to focus mainly on valuing the employee’s contributions, suggestions, and feedback in order to route to the success. There should be opportunities provided for the talent improvements of the individuals and time for generating innovative ideas in order to reach the success. Following the growth mindset is a “change in progress” in order to reach every new goal of the organization.</p>

        <p>Having a growth mindset and willing to take new opportunities / risks to excel in your career are the main requirements for the success of every individual.  Putting the best efforts in line to reach the targets will take you to success.  The individual success will always move into the path of career growth.</p>
        <p>Let me tell a short story of my life which led to success.</p>
        <p>“I started my career as a trainee in 2004 at a HitachiRail company (earlier it was known as USS) in Bangalore, after a couple of months theoretical training on Railway Signaling  which includes 2 weeks of training in the Indian railway institute (IRISET).</p>
        <p> I was assigned as a site engineer in Allahabad, UP.  Having a little knowledge on signaling and products also being a born and brought up from a small town in Tamil nadu (a state from down south of India and my hometown is near to Kanyakumari the south end of India) first time I have to move to a different state which is around 2311KMs from my native where we don’t have an office and I don’t know anyone.  I am the only kid for my parents and need to leave them alone in which case my dad is a heart patient who had just got a cardiac arrest a couple of months ago.  </p>

          <p> Taking this challenge as an opportunity to learn the systems and develop my career I went to Allahabad, learned the HitachiRail system in detail facing all the criticalities in the field and was working there for a year.  Considering that after a year of my learning I will get an opportunity to move back myself to the design office in Bangalore (which is comparatively close to my native) however, I got another challenge as I got transferred to Firozpur, Punjab(near to the Pakistan Border)as a site manager(in-charge) based on my good performances in Allahabad. However, this was a challenge for me in my personal life as I have to further travel 1100 kms towards the north but considering it as an opportunity to prove myself further in a next level as a site in charge I went to Punjab and succeeded in that assignment as well.<p>
          <p>  Based on my performances and capabilities of independently handling the local contractors, customers and managing the site activities which includes the verification of the design during testing and commissioning, I got the opportunity to work on the biggest project KFW (in 2006).  Once I entered the KFW project I concentrated on design and proved myself on the design capabilities by placing myself in Noida office for around 6 years sacrificing my expectations to work in Bangalore.  My goal and my growth mindset doesn’t get stopped, it continued and made me come across all the hurdles before me and placed me in a lot of positions from Design engineer, Team leader, Work Package Leader,  Design Manager, etc., and officially to reach as the Head of Metro Application India in 2019 in HitachRail.</p>

          <p>The term RAMS, apart from meaning Random Access Memory, also stands for Reliability Availability Maintainability and Safety, of which I am a member. The newborn team in Siemens Mobility is an active bunch of validators and safety engineers. We specialize in validation- and safety-related activities. This means we stamp the products that are fit and safe to use for railway applications. We are also invaluable when it comes to Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) and Customer Acceptance Assessments.</p>
          
          <p>While our early RAMS activities are confined to projects in the UK, our validation activities have been picked for projects in Germany and Spain. </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <p>RAMS has grown phenomenally during the course of a year, from a one-member team to nine members today. This is all thanks to the continuous efforts and successful deliveries of assigned projects. The team always strives to find the balance between the project constraints and RAMS aspects which is no easy task to achieve. Our team drives on 3Cs - Competency, Collaboration, and Communication.  The competency aspect of the team is not only taken care of with keen and considerate criteria for eligibility but also periodic nurturing within the team through Knowledge Sharing Sessions (KSS). </p>

       <p>These sessions contain learnings from specific projects, discussion of concepts, and introduction of techniques. Collaboration is done by offering training to fellow teams on EN standards, RAMS topics, and validation aspects. At Advanta level, the collaboration is reflected in our support for their safety-related queries as most teams find it hard to find the safety relatedness of their project’s or product’s functionality. Communication plays a key role in our work profile. It’s the medium for successful and smooth competency development and collaboration. </p>

            "Skill" & "Competency" are buzzwords in all the talent centric industries across the world, including Mobility. While importance attached to it is understood, there are limited avenues to holistically understand it as is vs a futuristic state. Organizations define tangible goals for growth, but this area lacked enough focus to measure the goals! That’s where a focused competence development & management approach garnered such significance in these times. In the Mobility industry, safety is an important objective for organizations. Standards like EN50128 (approved by CENELEC), ISO9001 & IEC61508 make it necessary to demonstrate & manage the competence of personnel, apart from stringent quality aspects.

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">What is Competency?</h3>  
        <img class="img-fluid img-colored" src="newTheme/img/talevo-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Sensing this need, a competency management system, Talevo (erstwhile CMS) was conceptualized & developed inhouse by Advanta Pune Mobility team members. What started as an idea, has evolved into a system which was rolled out in the ADVANTA Pune Mobility team in Oct’20 and is being rolled out to various departments across Mobility, Siemens. </p>
        <p>Talevo allows building a strategic talent management approach to define and track the competencies required for successfully delivering an organization’s business strategy. With this strategy, you can answer the following questions:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col">
        <ul>
          <li>Leadership Team - Which competencies does my organization / department need to achieve  desired business outcomes?</li>
          <li>Manager - Do I have the right competencies in my team to deliver project objectives?</li>
          <li>Employee - What competencies should I improve/build to fulfill my development targets?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid img-colored" src="newTheme/img/talevo-2.jpg" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Today, Talevo has been rolled out in MO, IT HUB, COBRA departments in Pune, while rollout is in progress for Hungary & Development Factory, RI, Germany. The rollout pipeline looks promising with France and Slovakia having expressed interest apart from interest exhibited by multiple stakeholders across the globe.</p>

            Imagine an employee struggling to deliver a project due to it requiring new skills and being unaware of whom to consult for technical issues. Think from the perspective of a manager of a team who has worked hard to ensure delivery despite skill gaps. Could he eliminate those risks or get the right people/expert help at the right time? How do we become a learning & future-ready organization with the talent we have in these VUCA times?

        <p>These are the challenges that the management at SMO DT IT HUB IN was trying to solve. Much to our fortune, the Advanta Pune Mobility team came up with a product that addresses these concerns while bringing both employees and managers in close alignment. And thus, the Talevo journey started for SMO DT IT HUB in India.</p>

        <p>Talevo is an in-house developed competency management system based on CENELEC standard and Master competency definition. It provides a clear framework of skills, application knowledge, and (behavior) abilities that employees must meet to fulfill their job expectations and contribute to the company's success. This product is developed to ensure competencies are captured, tracked, and updated in a transparent and easy way to help the site, department, and employees succeed. Talevo is an instrument to uncover gaps in the current state and empower users for quicker decisions to realize the organization’s vision. </p>
        <p>The rollout for Talevo in SMO DT IT HUB started on November 1st, 2020, and the date of handover to operations was decided as 15th February 2021. Within these timelines, all the modules comprising employee profile management, competency-based employee search, competency management, and competency review were scheduled to be completed. The HUB management decided to delegate the responsibility of Talevo Rollout to two project managers, Bhunesh Bhaskar & Abhishek Tripathi, from the Infrastructure Services team headed by Samarth Karnekar. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 info__col idea-box__col idea-box--alt">
        <p style="align-self: flex-start;">Since both these project managers had recently joined the organization, it was a great opportunity for them to showcase their project management skills. This rollout also gave them an opportunity to connect with their colleagues and team managers from different verticals within the HUB. Dividing all the activities into parallel work packages and adherence to timelines meant that the rollout was completed well within the given timeline. Post the successful implementation of this competency management system other business units and teams have started adopting the tool with the help of SMO DT IT HUB as a role model.</p>

        <p>Every big move on a new platform comes with a price tag. Saving on cloud maintenance holds a huge cost appeal, but migration can be so much more than that since migration projects run on three different costs – On-premises, Online, and Project and the efficiency saving comes with early ramp-down of legacy environment.</p>
        
        <p>With an accelerated project approach, we were able to bring down the costs by nearly 31%. </p>

        <h3 class="info__heading-dark-bg">The Accelerated Approach</h3>    
        <p>We decided to onboard SharePoint consultants from Infosys and IBM, helping us migrate medium and highly complex sites in parallel with the partner appointed by Siemens IT – Atos –  to migrate simple sites. It also became easier to define the right priorities to migrate first, starting from sites that required minimal effort but generated high cost.</p>

        <p>Another major contributor was an efficient housekeeping survey performed via a small application, which resulted in the deletion of 20% of sites that were no longer in use.</p>
        
        <p>Communication and structured migration processes played a critical role, keeping our users up-to-date and offering a central application to get the live migration status of their respective sites.</p>
        <p>All the different strategies, plans, and actions resulted in 50% ram-down already - a pioneer among all Siemens organizations.</p>
